Re: Syria aiding Qaddafi
This memo has two parts. Part one is the report that Syria is providing air support for Qaddafi. Part two is a note
to Cody from Lord David Owen, former UK foreign secretary on his views of an increasingly complex crisis. It
seems that the situation is developing into a protracted civil war with various nations backing opposing sides
with unforeseen consequences. Under these circumstances the crucial challenge is to deprive Qaddafi of his
strategic depthâ€”his support both financial and military.
I. Report
During the afternoon of March 3, advisers to Muammar Qaddafi stated privately that the Libyan
Leader has decided that civil war is inevitable, pitting troops and mercenary troops loyal to him
against the rebel forces gathering around Benghazi. Qaddafi is convinced that these rebels are
being supported by the United States, Western Europe and Israel. On March 2 Qaddafi told his
son Saif al-Islam that he believes the intelligence services of the United States, Great Britain,
Egypt, and France have deployed paramilitary officers to Benghazi to assist in organizing,
training, and equipping opposition forces. Qaddafi is convinced that the National Libyan Council
(NLC), and its leader, former Minister of Justice Mustafa Mohamed Abdel Galil have been
chosen by the foreign powers to replace him. On March 1 advisors to Qaddafi stated that

Qaddafi's cousin, Col. Ali Qaddafiddam had failed in efforts to recruit fighters among the
Egyptian population living immediately across the border with Libya.
These individuals added that during the week of February 21 the Libyan Leader spoke to Syrian
President Bashir al-Assad on at least three occasions by secure telephone lines. During the
conversations Qaddafi asked that Syrian officers and technicians currently training the Libyan
Air Force be placed under command of the Libyan Army and allowed to fight against the rebel
forces.
(Source Comment: Senior Libyan Army officers still loyal to Qaddafi added that On February
23, President Assad told General Isam Hallaq, the commander in chief of the Syrian Air Force,
to instruct the pilots and technicians in Tripoli to help the Libyan regime, should full scale Civil
War breaks out in the immediate future.)
On March 2, a military officer with ties to Qaddfi's son Khamis stated privately that the number
of Libyan pilots defecting to the opposition has destroyed the morale and professional spirit of
the Libyan Air Force at this critical moment, when Tripoli's air superiority is its principal weapon
against insurgents. In the opinion of this individual Qaddafi and his senior military advisors are
convinced that the European Union and the U.S will impose a no-fly zone over Libya in the
immediate future. These advisors believe that the no fly zone will serve as air support for
opposition forces. They are also prepared for the Western allies to bomb anti-aircraft facilities in
and around Tripoli in preparation for the establishment of the no-fly zone. Foreign Minister
Mousa Kousa is convinced that that Russia and Turkey will oppose the move, and may prevent
the implementation of the no fly zone.
The Syrian soldiers in Libya are part of a mission established in 1984 following the signing of a
military agreement between Qaddafi and Syria's long-time ruler and Bashir's father, Hafez al-
Assad, in the presence of General Soubhi Haddad, who was the commander in chief of the Air
Force at the time. Both Air Forces are equipped with Russian materiel and have had long-
standing, close links with Moscow.

In exchange for Syria's help, Libya provided financial support to the Syrian state, including funds
in support of operations carried out by the Syrian intelligence services in Lebanon. Libyan money
helped Hafez al-Assad bribe his brother Rifaat, the author of an attempted coup d'etat in 1983,
to leave the country and go into exile in Spain and France, where he has remained ever since.
According to individuals with access to the Syrian military, Damascus has also sent a second
team of pilots and technicians to Tripoli. These are lower-ranking officers loyal to the regime
who are specialized in flying helicopters. Before their departure for Tripoli on February 23, they
met with General Allaq and General Jamil Hasan, head of Air Force's Intelligence.
(Source Comment: During the afternoon of 3 March, an associate of Saif al-Islam Qaddafi
stated that he and the Libyan leaders other family members were concerned over the
announcement of Jose Luis Moreno-Ocampo, chief prosecutor of the International Criminal
Court (ICC), announced that he was investigating Qaddafi, his sons Khamis, the commander of
the 32 battalion, and Montasem, as well as the head of Gadhafi's personal security detail, the
Director-General of the External Security Organization (Abuzaid Dorda), the spokesman of the
regime (Musa Ibrahim), and the Minister of Foreign Affairs (Mousa Kousa). This source added
that Saif al-Islam had said that Qaddafi himself found the announcement amusing.)
From: Lord Owen
Cody,
Realistically the UN will not authorise a no fly zone while Gaddafi continues to hold off bombing and
strafing but keeping it up front and on the military agenda keeps him worried. Yet for a few frustrating months
that ambivalence kept the Serbian aeroplanes on the ground before we acted. My hope is that preparations
continue with visuals of planes flying off carriers, airborne early warning planes flying and people with clout
outside the Administration demanding preparations. But and it is a big BUT what else can and should we be
doing? Encourage humanitarian ships and convoys from Egypt to bring in supplies since we must ensure the
cities in the East can hold up living standards, maybe for months. More adventurous, Egyptian Special Forces to
go in and advise, even supplying hand held missiles. It appears they have few missiles; the military in the East
having been deliberately kept ill-equipped. There is old Nasserite sentiment for a Federation of Egypt, Sudan
and Libya. I know some will say Egypt has enough problems and they should stay resolutely focused on
domestic reforms. it is delicate but words alone and the balance of advantage will slip to Gaddafi. A Gaddafi
victory is possible and needs to be weighed in the balance now when deciding what to do.
I'm more worried than I am ready to say publicly.
Yours
David

Anti-Muslim film director in hiding, following
Libya, Egypt violence
By Nia-Malika Henderson and Michelle Boorstein, Updated: Wednesday, September 12,
1:30 PM
The director of a controversial anti-Islam film has gone into hiding, according to reports, fearing reprisals over a
work that has sparked violence in Egypt and Libya and led to the deaths of four Americans.
Sam Bacile, a California real estate developer, posted a 13-minute clip of ""The Innocence of Muslims,"" in July,
and the film became a lighting rod after the Egyptian media began showing parts of it on air and dubbed
versions of the English-language film appeared on the Internet.
It depicts the Prophet Muhammad as a bumbling idiot, born out of wedlock and making up verses to the Islamic
holy book to suit his purposes and desires. The film also shows him as having intimate relations with women
and suggests that he was gay.
Any flesh-and-blood depiction of Muhammad is offensive to Muslims.
""This is a political movie,"" Bacile, 56, told the Associated Press, adding that he didn't expect the film to spark
such fury. ""The U.S. lost a lot of money and a lot of people in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but we're fighting
with ideas.""
Bacile identified himself to several news organizations as an Israeli-born Jew who works as a real estate
developer in California. Yet his identity remains something of a mysteryâ€”Bacile is not listed in any directories
or incorporations or real estate deeds and is not licensed in California as a real estate broker. And Israeli
authorities told the Associated Press that they don't have any records of Bacile.

There are also questions about whether the film sparked the violence in Libya, which according to some reports
seemed to be more coordinated than the protests in Egypt where some 2,000 gathered outside the U.S. Embassy
in Cairo.
The eruption of violence came around the llth anniversary of the Sept. 11 terror attacks, as Americans paused
to remember the 3,000 people who lost their lives.
Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three others were killed after protesters attacked the U.S. consulate in
Benghazi.
Nihad Awad, national executive director of the Washington-based Council on American-Islamic Relations
(CAIR), condemned both the killings and the film. Awad said in a statement:
""We urge that this ignorant attempt to provoke the religious feelings of Muslims in the Arabic-speaking world
be ignored and that its extremist producers not be given the cheap publicity they so desperately seek.
""Those who created this trashy film do not represent the people of America or the Christian faith. The only
proper response to intentional provocations such as this film is to redouble efforts to promote mutual
understanding between faiths and to marginalize extremists of all stripes.""
A controversial Florida pastor was among those promoting ""The Innocence of Muslims,"" which cost $5 million
to make and stars amateur actors, some of whom appear to be wearing make-up to darken their faces.
Bacile said that the film was backed by 100 Jewish donors, according to Bacile.
Among the promoters is Morris Sadek, who heads the National American Cooptic Assembly and the Rev. Terry
Jones, leader of a small group that holds virulently anti-Islam events.
Tuesday evening, Jones sent out a press release blaming the Muslim faith for the protests and saying the group
would be running a trailer later in the evening for the film.
The trailer was part of a one-to-two hour ""live event"" that Jones was doing from his Gainesville center for Sept.
11, said Fran Ingram, a spokeswoman for his group, Stand Up America. The whole broadcast included the
handlebar-moustached pastor in a black ""infidel"" t-shirt standing in front of a fabric lynched devil dressed in a
white turban for what they group dubbed ""International Judge Muhammed Day.""
It wasn't clear if Jones, who garnered worldwide attention in recent years with his threats to burn the Koran,
had promoted ""The Innocence of Muslims"" before the rioting began.
Asked if Jones was connected in any way with the making of the film, Ingram said she couldn't comment.

Re: Syria aiding Qaddafi
This memo has two parts. Part one is the report that Syria is providing air support for Qaddafi. Part two is a note
to Cody from Lord David Owen, former UK foreign secretary on his views of an increasingly complex crisis. It
seems that the situation is developing into a protracted civil war with various nations backing opposing sides
with unforeseen consequences. Under these circumstances the crucial challenge is to deprive Qaddafi of his
strategic depth--his support both financial and military.
I. Report
During the afternoon of March 3, advisers to Muammar Qaddafi stated privately that the Libyan
Leader has decided that civil war is inevitable, pitting troops and mercenary troops loyal to him
against the rebel forces gathering around Benghazi. Qaddafi is convinced that these rebels are
being supported by the United States, Western Europe and Israel. On March 2 Qaddafi told his
son Saif al-Islam that he believes the intelligence services of the United States, Great Britain,

Egypt, and France have deployed paramilitary officers to Benghazi to assist in organizing,
training, and equipping opposition forces. Qaddafi is convinced that the National Libyan Council
(NLC), and its leader, former Minister of Justice Mustafa Mohamed Abdel Galil have been
chosen by the foreign powers to replace him. On March 1 advisors to Qaddafi stated that
Qaddafi's cousin, Col. Ali Qaddafiddam had failed in efforts to recruit fighters among the
Egyptian population living immediately across the border with Libya.
These individuals added that during the week of February 21 the Libyan Leader spoke to Syrian
President Bashir al-Assad on at least three occasions by secure telephone lines. During the
conversations Qaddafi asked that Syrian officers and technicians currently training the Libyan
Air Force be placed under command of the Libyan Army and allowed to fight against the rebel
forces.
(Source Comment: Senior Libyan Army officers still loyal to Qaddafi added that On February
23, President Assad told General Isam HaIlaq, the commander in chief of the Syrian Air Force,
to instruct the pilots and technicians in Tripoli to help the Libyan regime, should full scale Civil
War breaks out in the immediate future.)
On March 2, a military officer with ties to Qaddfi's son Khamis stated privately that the number
of Libyan pilots defecting to the opposition has destroyed the morale and professional spirit of
the Libyan Air Force at this critical moment, when Tripoli's air superiority is its principal weapon
against insurgents. In the opinion of this individual Qaddafi and his senior military advisors are
convinced that the European Union and the U.S will impose a no-fly zone over Libya in the
immediate future. These advisors believe that the no fly zone will serve as air support for
opposition forces. They are also prepared for the Western allies to bomb anti-aircraft facilities in
and around Tripoli in preparation for the establishment of the no-fly zone. Foreign Minister
Mousa Kousa is convinced that that Russia and Turkey will oppose the move, and may prevent
the implementation of the no fly zone.
The Syrian soldiers in Libya are part of a mission established in 1984 following the signing of a
military agreement between Qaddafi and Syria's long-time ruler and Bashir's father, Hafez al-

Assad, in the presence of General Soubhi Haddad, who was the commander in chief of the Air
Force at the time. Both Air Forces are equipped with Russian materiel and have had long-
standing, close links with Moscow.
In exchange for Syria's help, Libya provided financial support to the Syrian state, including funds
in support of operations carried out by the Syrian intelligence services in Lebanon. Libyan money
helped Hafez al-Assad bribe his brother Rifaat, the author of an attempted coup d'etat in 1983,
to leave the country and go into exile in Spain and France, where he has remained ever since.
According to individuals with access to the Syrian military, Damascus has also sent a second
team of pilots and technicians to Tripoli. These are lower-ranking officers loyal to the regime
who are specialized in flying helicopters. Before their departure for Tripoli on February 23, they
met with General Allaq and General Jamil Hasan, head of Air Force's Intelligence.
(Source Comment: During the afternoon of 3 March, an associate of Saif al-Islam Qaddafi
stated that he and the Libyan leaders other family members were concerned over the
announcement of Jose Luis Moreno-Ocampo, chief prosecutor of the International Criminal
Court (ICC), announced that he was investigating Qaddafi, his sons Khamis, the commander of
the 32 battalion, and Montasem, as well as the head ofGadhaffs personal security detail, the
Director-General of the External Security Organization (Abuzaid Dorda), the spokesman of the
regime (Musa Ibrahim), and the Minister of Foreign Affairs (Mousa Kousa). This source added
that Saif al-Islam had said that Qaddafi himself found the announcement amusing.)
From: Lord Owen
Cody,
Realistically the UN will not authorise a no fly zone while Gaddafi continues to hold off bombing and
strafing but keeping it up front and on the military agenda keeps him worried. Yet for a few frustrating months
that ambivalence kept the Serbian aeroplanes on the ground before we acted. My hope is that preparations
continue with visuals of planes flying off carriers, airborne early warning planes flying and people with clout
outside the Administration demanding preparations. But and it is a big BUT what else can and should we be
doing? Encourage humanitarian ships and convoys from Egypt to bring in supplies since we must ensure the
cities in the East can hold up living standards, maybe for months. More adventurous, Egyptian Special Forces to
go in and advise, even supplying hand held missiles. It appears they have few missiles; the military in the East
having been deliberately kept ill-equipped. There is old Nasserite sentiment for a Federation of Egypt, Sudan
and Libya. I know some will say Egypt has enough problems and they should stay resolutely focused on
domestic reforms. it is delicate but words alone and the balance of advantage will slip to Gaddafi. A Gaddafi

Yesterday, our U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya was attacked. Heavily armed militants assaulted the compound
and set fire to our buildings, American and Libyan security personnel battled the attackers together, Four Americans
were killed, They included Sean Smith, a Foreign Service information management officer, and our Ambassador to Libya
Chris Stevens. We are still making next of kin notifications for the other two individuals.
This is an attack that should shock the conscience of people of all faiths around the vvorld. We condemn in the strongest
terms this senseless act of violence, and we send our prayers to the families, friends, and colleagues of those we've lost.
All over the world, every day, America's diplomats and development experts risk their lives in the service of our country
and our values, because they believe that the United States must be a force for peace and progress in the world, that

these aspirations are worth striving and sacrificing for. Alongside our men and women in uniform, they represent the
best traditions of a bold and generous nation.
In the lobby of this building, the State Department, the names of those who have fallen in the line of duty are inscribed
in marble. Our hearts break over each one. And now, because of this tragedy, we have new heroes to honor and more
friends to mourn.
Chris Stevens fell in love with the Middle East as a young Peace Corps volunteer teaching English in Morocco. He joined
the Foreign Service, learned languages, won friends for America in distant places, and made other people's hopes his
own.
In the early days of the Libyan revolution, I asked Chris to be our envoy to the rebel opposition. He arrived on a cargo
ship in the port of Benghazi and began building our relationships with Libya's revolutionaries. He risked his life to stop a
tyrant, then gave his life trying to help build a better Libya. The world needs more Chris Stevenses. I spoke with his
sister, Ann, this morning, and told her that he will be remembered as a hero by many nations.
Sean Smith was an Air Force veteran. He spent 10 years as an information management officer in the State Department,
he was posted at The Hague, and was in Libya on a brief temporary assignment. He was a husband to his wife Heather,
with whom I spoke this morning. He was a father to two young children, Samantha and Nathan. They will grow up being
proud of the service their father gave to our country, service that took him from Pretoria to Baghdad, and finally to
Benghazi.
The mission that drew Chris and Sean and their colleagues to Libya is both noble and necessary, and we arid the people
of Libya honor their memory by carrying it forward. This is not easy. Today, many Americans are asking indeed, I asked
myself â€” how could this happen? How could this happen in a country we helped liberate, in a city we helped save from
destruction? This question reflects just how complicated and, at times, how confounding the world can be
But we must be clear-eyed, even in our grief. This was an attack by a small and savage group â€” not the people or
Government of Libya. Everywhere Chris and his team went in Libya, in a country scarred by war and tyranny, they were
hailed as friends and partners. And when the attack came yesterday, Libyans stood and fought to defend our post, Some
were wounded. Libyans carried Chris' body to the hospital, and they helped rescue and lead other Americans to safety.
And last night, when I spoke with the President of Libya, he strongly condemned the violence and pledged every effort
to protect our people and pursue those responsible.
The friendship between our countries, borne out of shared struggle, will not be another casualty of this attack. A free
and stable Libya is still in America's interest and security, and we will not turn our back on that nor will we rest until
those responsible for these attacks are found and brought to justice. We are working closely with the Libyan authorities
to move swiftly and surely. We are also working with partners around the world to safeguard other American embassies,
consulates, and citizens.
There will be more time later to reflect, but today, we have work to do. There is no higher priority than protecting our
men and women wherever they serve. We are working to determine the precise motivations and methods of those who
carried out this assault. Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior, along with the protest that took place at our
Embassy in Cairo yesterday, as a response to inflammatory material posted on the Internet. America's commitment to
religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation. But let me be clear â€”there is no justification for this,
none. Violence like this is no way to honor religion or faith. And as long as there are those who would take innocent life
in the name of God, the world will never know a true and lasting peace.

It is especially difficult that this happened on September 11th. It's an anniversary that means a great deal to all
Americans. Every year on that day, we are reminded that our work is not yet finished, that the job of putting an end to
violent extremism and building a safe and stable world continues. But September 11th means even more than that. It is a
day on which we remember thousands of American heroes, the bonds that connect all Americans, wherever we are on
this Earth, and the values that see us through every storm. And now it is a day on which we will remember Sean, Chris,
and their colleagues.
May God bless them, and may God bless the thousands of Americans working in every corner of the world who make
this country the greatest force for peace, prosperity, and progress, and a force that has always stood for human dignity â€”
the greatest force the world has ever known. And may God continue to bless the United States of America.

SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional
Council, as well as the highest levels of European Governments, and Western
Intelligence and security services.
THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION COMES FROM AN EXTREMELY
SENSITIVE SOURCE AND SHOULD BE HANDLED WITH CARE.
1. On September 12, 2012 Libyan President Mohammed Yussef el Magariaf
told senior advisors that the death of the U.S. Ambassador at the hands of Islamist
militia forces represents a threat to the future of the newly elected General National
Congress (GNC) Government. According to a sensitive source, el Magariaf
believes that the primary goal of this and other attacks on Western facilities is to
demonstrate that the GNC cannot protect its non-Islamic friends. Libyan security
officials believe that the attack was carried out by forces of the Islamist militia
group calling itself the Ansar al Sharia brigade; working out of camps in the
Eastern suburbs of Benghazi. These officials added that their sources indicate that
this group is led by former members of the old Libyan Islamic Fighting Group
(LIFG), some of whom are loyal to Islamist General Abdelhakim Belhaj. The
same officials were quick to point out that they have no evidence that Belhaj had
any direct involvement in this attack. They also have no direct information as to
whether this assault has anything to do with the death of Libyan born al Qai'da
leader Abu Yahya al- Libi, but they are pursuing this theme. These officials do

believe that the attackers having prepared to launch their assault took advantage of
the cover provided by the demonstrations in Benghazi protesting an intemet
production seen as disrespectful to the prophet Mohammed.
2. According to this source, the immediate events were set in motion by a
statement made by a Muslim Cleric in Egypt saying that the internet film was
going to be shown across the United States on September 11 in an effort to insult
Muslims on the anniversary of the attacks on the New York World Trade Center in
2001. This statement inspired increasingly hostile demonstrations at the U.S.
Embassy in Cairo, and at diplomatic facilities in Libya. In Benghazi, reporting
from security sources states, approximately twenty one (21) Ansar al Sharia
fighters left their base in East Benghazi just after sundown infiltrated the crowd of
about 2,000 demonstrators at the U.S. Consulate. These forces, operating under
cover of darkness, opened fire on the consulate, eventually setting it on fire with
rocket propelled grenades. These fighters then withdrew to their camp. El
Magariaf ordered security officials to identify and arrest the attackers, adding that
he had been in touch with Egyptian President Mohm_med Morsi, and the two
agreed that their intelligence and security personnel will cooperate in this matter.
(Note: Some of the Libyan officials believe that the entire demonstration was
organized as cover for the attack, however; they point out that there is no evidence
of such a complex operation at this time.
3.(Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, Libyan security
officers also informed el Magariaf that the attacks had been planned for
approximately one month, based on casing information obtained during an early
demonstration at the U.S. consulate in Benghazi. The attackers were, in the
opinion of these individuals, looking for an opportunity to approach the consulate

under cover in a crowd. These officials add that government security officers
admitted to el Magariaf that they do not have the physical capacity to locate,
attack, and destroy the Ansar al-Sharia brigade, among others. They describe these
forces as well-trained, hardened killers; many of whom have spent time in
Afghanistan and Yemen. These fighters are located in camps in Eastern Libya; and
Libyan officials doubt they can penetrate these camps because the militia's are
better armed than the forces of the new National Army.
4. In the opinion of a separate source El Magariaf continues to believe that
the attacks were planned and carried out in a political atmosphere where a portion
of the Libyan population is focused on past cooperation between Western
intelligence and security services, and the regime of former dictator Muammar al
Qaddafi. According to this source, el Magariaf realizes that the death of the U.S.
Ambassador dictates that he must find tangible solutions to the problems tied to
disarming the militias, dealing Salafist violence against the followers of Sufi
beliefs, and efforts to discredit his government through linking him to Western
intelligence services. El Magariaf instructed his security officials to cooperate
with their U.S. counterparts. He also warned all of his advisors to be prepared for
U.S. retaliation against the suspected perpetrators of this attack, and the angry
public reaction that is sure to follow.
5. (Source Comment: A separate, particularly sensitive source added that in
private conversation el Magariaf stated that if his government cannot protect a
senior diplomatic official, foreign businesses will not be willing to risk opening up
new operations in Libya. According to this sensitive source, el Magariaf believes
that a number of the Islamist militias are now being influenced al Qai'da and other
radical groups; working out of camps in the Eastern and Southeastern parts of the

country. These groups are receiving aid and weapons from supporters in Sudan.
In the end, el Magariaf added that while he does not expect U.S. officials to focus
on this point, he believes the attacks against the interests and citizens of the U.S.
and other Western states are aimed first at overthrowing his government, and
replacing it with a strict Islamic Republic dominated by Salafist leaders. Magariaf
also warned that tribal militias loyal to the Qaddaft family continue to present an
equally dangerous threat to the new Government.)

Anne-Marie Slaughter is a professor of politics and international affairs at Princeton.
By Anne-Marie Slaughter
PRESIDENT Obama says the noose is tightening around Col. Muammar al-Qaddafi. In fact, it is
tightening around the Libyan rebels, as Colonel Qaddafi makes the most of the world's dithering and
steadily retakes rebel-held tow.ns, The United States and Europe are temporizing on a no-flight zone
while the Organization of the Islamic Conference, the Gulf Cooperation Council and now the Arab
League have all called on the United Nations Security Council to authorize one. Opponents of a no-
flight zone have put forth five main arguments, none of which, on closer examination, hold up.
It's not in our interest. Gen. Wesley K. Clark argues that ""Libya doesn't sell much oil to the United
States"" and that while Americans ""want to support democratic movements in the region,"" they are
already doing that in Iraq and Afghanistan. Framing this issue in terms of oil is exactly what Arab
populations and indeed much of the world expect, which is why they are so cynical about our
professions of support for democracy and human rights. Now we have a chance to support a new
beginning in the Muslim world â€” a new beginning of accountable governments that can provide
services and opportunities for their citizens in ways that could dramatically decrease support for
terrorist groups and violent extremism. It's hard to imagine something more in our strategic interest.
It will be counter-productive. Many thoughtful commentators, including Al Jazeera's director
general, Wadah Khanfar, argue that what is most important about the Arab spring is that it is coming
from Arabs themselves. From this perspective, Western military intervention will play right into
Qaddati's hands, allowing him to broadcast pictures of Western bombs falling on Arab civilians. But
these arguments, while important, must be weighed against the appeals of of Libyan opposition
fighters asking for international help, and now, astonishingly, against support for a no-flight zone by
some of the same governments that have kept their populations quiescent by holding up the specter of
foreign intervention. Assuming that a no-flight zone can be imposed by an international coalition that
includes Arab states, we have an opportunity to establish a new narrative of Western support for Arab
democrats.

It won't work. The United States ambassador to NATO, Ivo H. Daaider, argues that stopping
Colonel Qaddafi's air force will not be decisive; he will continue to inflict damage with tanks and
helicopters, bombing oil refineries and depots on his way to retaking key towns. But the potential
effect of a no-flight zone must also be assessed in terms of Colonel Qaddafi's own calculations about
his future. Richard Downie of the Center for Strategic and International Studies argues that although
Colonel Qaddafi cultivates a mad-dictator image, he has been a canny survivor and political
manipulator for 40 years. He is aware of debates with regard to a no-flight zone and is timing his
military campaign accordingly; he is also capable of using his air force just enough to gain strategic
advantage, but not enough to trigger a no-flight zone. If the international community lines up against
him and is willing to crater his runways and take out his antiaircraft weapons, he might well renew his
offer of a negotiated departure.
If it does work, we don't know what we will get. Revolutions are almost always followed by internal
divisions among the revolutionaries. We should not expect a rosy, Jeffersonian Libya. But the choice
is between uncertainty and the certainty that if Colonel Qaddafi wins, regimes acrosS the region will
conclude that force is the livay to answer protests. And when Colonel Qaddafi massacres the
opposition, young protesters across the Middle East will conclude that when we were asked to support
their cause with more than words, we blinked. Americans in turn will read the words of Mr. Obama's
June 2009 speech in Cairo., with its lofty promises to stand for universal human rights, and cringe.
Let's arm the rebels instead. Some commentators who agree with the analysis above say we could
'better accomplish our goals by providing intelligence and arms to the opposition. That would, of
course, be much easier for us. It undoubtedly appeals to Mn Obama as a neat compromise between
the desire to help the protesters and the desire not to overrule his defense secretary's reluctance to
participate in a no-flight zone. But we would be providing arms not to a disciplined military, but to
ragged groups of brave volunteers who barely know how to use the weapons they have. They need
action that will change the situation on. the ground for Colonel Qaddafi, as well as his the calculations.
Moreover, by the time arms and intelligence could take effect, it is quite likely that Colonel Qaddafi
will have retaken or at least besieged .Benghazi, the opposition stronghold.
The United States should immediately ask the Security Council to authorize a no-flight zOne and
make clear to Russia and China that if they block the resolution, the blood of the Libyan opposition
will be on their hands. We should push them at least to abstain and bring the issue to a vote as soon as
possible. If we get a resolution, we should work with the Arab League to quickly assemble an
international coalition to impose the no-flight zone. If the Security Council fails toact, then we should
recognize the opposition Interim National Council as the legitimate Libyan government, as France has
done, and work with the Arab League to give the council any assistance it requests:

Any use of force must be carefully and fully debated, but that debate has now been had. Ifs been

Subject: AbZ and Hb3 on Libya and West Bank/Gaza
(SBU) I had back-to-back phone calls this morning from Qatari PM/FM Hamad bin Jassim and UAE Foreign
Minister Abdullah bin Zayed. The content was virtually identical, su esting either rare coincidence or, more
likely, an unusual level of UAE-Qatari coordination at yesterday's Arab League meeting. Main points (mostly
Libya related but one Palestinian-related) are as follows:
(SBU) No-Fly Zone: The Arab League has now called for a NFZ; the UNSC needs to act. Syria was the last hold-
out, but the resolution passed. Time is wasting. Both HbJ and AbZ made the right kind of noises (but still less
than a solid commitment) that there would be some kind of Qatari and Emirati participation in an
international effort. Their chicken-and-egg question to me was, are we going to support a NFZ? If we are,
then we can talk about the other participation.
(SBU) Recognizing the Council: Both urged us to do so. I noted that the Arab League statement fell short of
recognition. They urged us to find some kind of language that would suggest moving in that direction, and I
noted our decisions to suspend the operations of the Libyan Embassy, have S meet with Mahmoud Jibril of the
Council, and send a diplomatic representative to Benghazi. They pushed for more, with HbJ going to far as to
say that recognition of the Council will help underscore to Qadhafi and his circle that he's finished.
(SBU) Jibril meeting: They each said the same thing that Gene Cretz has picked up separately, that Jibril
doesn't want media for his meeting with S unless he feels that there will be something significant out of the
meeting. HbJ is providing a plane for Jibril to get to Paris. HbJ more than AbZ agreed with me that the
meeting itself is a significant deliverable; AbZ urged us not to be slower or quieter than France.
(SBU) West Bank/Gaza: Both reacted negatively to Israeli announcements regarding ""hundreds of houses"" in
the West Bank. They asked if we were going to say anything; I noted we were still at this point getting the
facts. ""Jeff, you guys just aren't serious,"" AbZ complained. I noted the political context, in which a family was
brutally murdered.

Libyan officials doubt they can penetrate these camps because the militia's are
better armed than the forces of the new National Army.
4. In the opinion of a separate source El Magariaf continues to believe that
the attacks were planned and carried out in a political atmosphere where a portion
of the Libyan population is focused on past cooperation between Western
intelligence and security services, and the regime of former dictator Muammar al
Qadclafi. According to this source, el Magariaf realizes that the death of the U.S.
Ambassador dictates that he must find tangible solutions to the problems tied to
disarming the militias, dealing Salafist violence against the followers of Sufi
beliefs, and efforts to discredit his government through linking him to Western
intelligence services. El Magariaf instructed his security officials to cooperate
with their U.S. counterparts. He also warned all of his advisors to be prepared for
U.S. retaliation against the suspected perpetrators of this attack, and the angry
public reaction that is sure to follow.
5. (Source comment: A separate, particularly sensitive source added that in
private conversation el Magariaf stated that if his government cannot protect a
senior diplomatic official, foreign businesses will not be willing to risk opening up
new operations in Libya. According to this sensitive source, el Magariaf believes
that a number of the Islamist militias are now being influenced al Qarcla and other
radical groups; working out of camps in the Eastern and Southeastern parts of the

In the end, el Magariaf added that while he does not expect U.S. officials to focus
on this point, he believes the attacks against the interests and citizens of the U.S.
and other Western states are aimed first at overthrowing his government, and
replacing it with a strict Islamic Republic dominated by Salafist leaders. Magariaf
also warned that tribal militias loyal to the Qaddafi family continue to present an
equally dangerous threat to the new Goverment.)

wanted to make sure you had a heads up. AM
Anne-Marie Slaughter is a professor of politics and international affairs at Princeton.
By Anne-Marie Slaughter
PRESIDENT Obama says the noose is tightening around Col. Muammar al-Qaddafi. In fact, it is
tightening around the Libyan rebels, as Colonel Qaddafi makes the most of the world's dithering and
steadily retakes rebel-held tow.ns, The United States and Europe are temporizing on a no-flight zone
while the Organization of the Islamic Conference, the Gulf Cooperation Council and now the Arab
League have all called on the United Nations Security Council to authorize one. Opponents of a no-
flight zone have put forth five main arguments, none of which, on closer examination, hold up.
It's not in our interest. Gen. Wesley K. Clark argues that ""Libya doesn't sell much oil to the United
States"" and that while Americans ""want to support democratic movements in the region,"" they are
already doing that in Iraq and Afghanistan. Framing this issue in terms of oil is exactly what Arab
populations and indeed much of the world expect, which is why they are so cynical about our
professions of support for democracy and human rights. Now we have a chance to support a new
beginning in the Muslim world â€” a new beginning of accountable governments that can provide
services and opportunities for their citizens in ways that could dramatically decrease support for
terrorist groups and violent extremism. It's hard to imagine something more in our strategic interest.
It will be counter-productive. Many thoughtful commentators, including Al Jazeera's director
general, Wadah Khanfar, argue that what is most important about the Arab spring is that it is coming
from Arabs themselves. From this perspective, Western military intervention will play right into
Qaddati's hands, allowing him to broadcast pictures of Western bombs falling on Arab civilians. But
these arguments, while important, must be weighed against the appeals of of Libyan opposition
fighters asking for international help, and now, astonishingly, against support for a no-flight zone by
some of the same governments that have kept their populations quiescent by holding up the specter of
foreign intervention. Assuming that a no-flight zone can be imposed by an international coalition that
includes Arab states, we have an opportunity to establish a new narrative of Western support for Arab
democrats.

It won't work. The United States ambassador to NATO, Ivo H. Daaider, argues that stopping
Colonel Qaddafi's air force will not be decisive; he will continue to inflict damage with tanks and
helicopters, bombing oil refineries and depots on his way to retaking key towns. But the potential
effect of a no-flight zone must also be assessed in terms of Colonel Qaddafi's own calculations about
his future. Richard Downie of the Center for Strategic and International Studies argues that although
Colonel Qaddafi cultivates a mad-dictator image, he has been a canny survivor and political
manipulator for 40 years. He is aware of debates with regard to a no-flight zone and is timing his
military campaign accordingly; he is also capable of using his air force just enough to gain strategic
advantage, but not enough to trigger a no-flight zone. If the international community lines up against
him and is willing to crater his runways and take out his antiaircraft weapons, he might well renew his
offer of a negotiated departure.
If it does work, we don't know what we will get. Revolutions are almost always followed by internal
divisions among the revolutionaries. We should not expect a rosy, Jeffersonian Libya. But the choice
is between uncertainty and the certainty that if Colonel Qaddafi wins, regimes acrosS the region will
conclude that force is the livay to answer protests. And when Colonel Qaddafi massacres the
opposition, young protesters across the Middle East will conclude that when we were asked to support
their cause with more than words, we blinked. Americans in turn will read the words of Mr. Obama's
June 2009 speech in Cairo., with its lofty promises to stand for universal human rights, and cringe.
Let's arm the rebels instead. Some commentators who agree with the analysis above say we could
'better accomplish our goals by providing intelligence and arms to the opposition. That would, of
course, be much easier for us. It undoubtedly appeals to Mn Obama as a neat compromise between
the desire to help the protesters and the desire not to overrule his defense secretary's reluctance to
participate in a no-flight zone. But we would be providing arms not to a disciplined military, but to
ragged groups of brave volunteers who barely know how to use the weapons they have. They need
action that will change the situation on. the ground for Colonel Qaddafi, as well as his the calculations.
Moreover, by the time arms and intelligence could take effect, it is quite likely that Colonel Qaddafi
will have retaken or at least besieged .Benghazi, the opposition stronghold.
The United States should immediately ask the Security Council to authorize a no-flight zOne and
make clear to Russia and China that if they block the resolution, the blood of the Libyan opposition
will be on their hands. We should push them at least to abstain and bring the issue to a vote as soon as
possible. If we get a resolution, we should work with the Arab League to quickly assemble an
international coalition to impose the no-flight zone. If the Security Council fails toact, then we should
recognize the opposition Interim National Council as the legitimate Libyan government, as France has
done, and work with the Arab League to give the council any assistance it requests:

Any use of force must be carefully and fully debated, but that debate has now been had. Ifs been

and around the world. She was emphathetic and unflinching and inspiring; she was wise and steady and strong. My 80
year old mother called from LA to say ""She was like our rock of Gibraltar"". What greater compliment for the Secretary of

SUBJECT: Libya (37)
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional
Council, as well as the highest levels of European Governments, and Western
Intelligence and security services.
THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION COMES FROM AN EXTREMELY
SENSITIVE SOURCE AND SHOULD BE HANDLED WITH CARE,
1. On September 12, 2012 Libyan President Mohammed Yussef el Magariaf
told senior advisors that the death of the U.S. Ambassador at the hands of Islamist
militia forces represents a threat to the future of the newly elected General National
Congress (GNC) Government. According to a sensitive source, el Magariaf
believes that the primary goal of this and other attacks on Western facilities is to
demonstrate that the GNC cannot protect its non-Islamic friends. Libyan security
officials believe that the attack was carried out by forces of the Islamist militia
group calling itself the Ansar al Sharia brigade; working out of camps in the
Eastern suburbs of Benghazi. These officials added that their sources indicate that
this group is led by former members of the old Libyan Islamic Fighting Group
(LIFG), some of whom are loyal to Islamist General Abclelhakim Belhaj. The
same officials were quick to point out that they have no evidence that Belhaj had
any direct involvement in this attack. They also have no direct information as to
whether this assault has anything to do with the death of Libyan born al Qai'da
leader Abu Yahya al- Libi, but they are pursuing this theme. These officials do

believe that the attackers having prepared to launch their assault took advantage of
the cover provided by the demonstrations in Benghazi protesting an internet
production seen as disrespectful to the prophet Mohammed.
2. According to this source, the immediate events were set in motion by a
statement made by a Muslim Cleric in Egypt saying that the interne film was
going to be shown across the United States on September 11 in an effort to insult
Muslims on the anniversary of the attacks on the New York World Trade Center in
2001. This statement inspired increasingly hostile demonstrations at the U.S.
Embassy in Cairo, and at diplomatic facilities in Libya. In Benghazi, reporting
from security sources states, approximately twenty one (21) Ansar al Sharia
fighters left their base in East Benghazi just after sundown infiltrated the crowd of
about 2,000 demonstrators at the U.S. Consulate. These forces, operating under
cover of darkness, opened fire on the consulate, eventually setting it on fire with
rocket propelled grenades. These fighters then withdrew to their camp. El
Magariaf ordered security officials to identify and arrest the attackers, adding that
he had been in touch with Egyptian President Mohmmed Morsi, and the two
agreed that their intelligence and security personnel will cooperate in this matter.
(Note: Some of the Libyan officials believe that the entire demonstration was
organized as cover for the attack, however; they point out that there is no evidence
of such a complex operation at this time.
3. (Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, Libyan security
officers also informed el Magariaf that the attacks had been planned for
approximately one month, based on casing information obtained during an early
demonstration at the U.S. consulate in Benghazi. The attackers were, in the
opinion of these individuals, looking for an opportunity to approach the consulate

under cover in a crowd. These officials add that government security officers
admitted to el Magariaf that they do not have the physical capacity to locate,
attack, and destroy the Ansar al-Sharia brigade, among others. They describe these
forces as well-trained, hardened killers; many of whom have spent time in
Afghanistan and Yemen. These fighters are located in camps in Eastern Libya; and
Libyan officials doubt they can penetrate these camps because the militia's are
better armed than the forces of the new National Army.
4. In the opinion of a separate source El Magariaf continues to believe that
the attacks were planned and carried out in a political atmosphere where a portion
of the Libyan population is focused on past cooperation between Western
intelligence and security services, and the regime of former dictator Muammar al
Qaddafi. According to this source, el Magariaf realizes that the death of the U.S.
Ambassador dictates that he must find tangible solutions to the problems tied to
disarming the militias, dealing Salafist violence against the followers of Sufi
beliefs, and efforts to discredit his government through linking him to Western
intelligence services. El Magariaf instructed his security officials to cooperate
with their U.S. counterparts. He also warned all of his advisors to be prepared for
U.S. retaliation against the suspected perpetrators of this attack, and the angry
public reaction that is sure to follow.
5. (Source Comment: A separate, particularly sensitive source added that in
private conversation el Magariaf stated that if his government cannot protect a
senior diplomatic official, foreign businesses will not be willing to risk opening up
new operations in Libya. According to this sensitive source, el Magariaf believes
that a number of the Islamist militias are now being influenced al Qai'da and other
radical groups; working out of camps in the Eastern and Southeastern parts of the

country. These groups are receiving aid and weapons from supporters in Sudan.
In the end, el Magariaf added that while he does not expect U.S. officials to focus
on this point, he believes the attacks against the interests and citizens of the U.S.
and other Western states are aimed first at overthrowing his government, and
replacing it with a strict Islamic Republic dominated by Salafist leaders. Magariaf
also warned that tribal militias loyal to the Qaddafi family continue to present an
equally dangerous threat to the new Government.)

1. During the afternoon of September 11, 2012 new interim President of Libya
Mohammed Yussef el Magariaf spoke in private with senior advisors, including the
members of the Libyan Muslim Brotherhood, to discuss the attacks by demonstrators
on U.S. missions in Tripoli and Benghazi. According to a sensitive source, el Magariaf
was shaken by the attacks, and gave permission to commanders on the ground for
security forces to open fire over the heads of the crowds in an effort to break up mobs
attacking the missions. During this session, a senior security officer told el Magariaf
that the attacks on that day were inspired by what many devout Libyan viewed as a

sacrilegious internet video on the prophet Mohammed originating in America. The
Libyan attacks were also inspired by and linked to an attack on the U.S. mission in
Egypt on the same day. At the same time, el Magariaf noted in strong terms that the
atmosphere that made fostered these incidents in Libya is the product of widespread
publicity regarding the security situation in the country between 2004 and 2010 and
the cooperation that developed between a number of Western Intelligence services and
the regime of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi.
2. This source added that el Magariafs advisors believe that this situation adds
to the President's growing concern over the unpredictable effects that will follow
current covert efforts by his political opponents to link him directly to foreign
intelligence services. According to a separate sensitive source, el Magariaf noted that
his opponents had often tried to connect him to the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency
(CIA) through the National Front for the Salvation of Libya (NFSL), a group
established in opposition to former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi, which el Magariaf
led in the 1980s. In the opinion of this individual el Magariaf believes that he can
survive potential negative publicity in this regard, but if this situation continues to
develop in this manner it will complicate his efforts to establish an orderly
administration in the country. Again, he stated that the attacks on the U.S. missions
were as much a result of the atmosphere created by this campaign, as the controversial
internet video.
3. At the same time, this individual noted that several of el Magariafs advisors
share his concerns in this matter, pointing out that the return of Qaddafi's intelligence
chief Abdullah al-Seno-ussi for trial in Libya has heightened public interest in the
liaison relationships conducted by the CIA and British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS)
with Qaddfi's intelligence and security services. These same individuals note that they
believe Islamist militia forces under the command of General Abdelhaldm Belhaj
captured files and documents describing this relationship from Qaddafi's offices in
Tripoli. This fascination with Western intelligence operations in Qaddafi's Libya is also
driven by Human Rights Watch (HRW) and its efforts to tie Western governments to
human rights violations committed under Qaddafi. In this regard HRW has
interviewed at least fourteen (14) individuals claiming that they were turned over to
Qaddafi's forces by the Western powers. Belhaj is included in this group.
4. (Source Comment: In the opinion of a very sensitive source, el Magariafs
enemies are working to take advantage of his suspected links to the CIA at a time when
Western intelligence services are under scrutiny in Libya. They also fear that this
situation will only grow more complex as Qaddafi's son Saif al Islam Qaddafi and al
Senousi are brought before Libyan courts to answer for their crimes under the old
regime, particularly during the 2011 revolution. These individuals believe both men
will be linked to Western Intelligence during their trials. )
5. According to this individual, el Magariaf is working with the Muslim
Brotherhood and other Islamist groups to defuse this situation. He is particularly

concerned by the level of violence between Sufi Muslims and Salafists, and believes he
must maintain his reputation for impartiality if he is to defuse this growing problem.
As he works to organize the government, and disarm the militias, he cannot afford to
lose the respect and trust of the Libyan people, especially at a time when cultural
clashes between followers of the mystical Sufi tradition and ultra-conservative Salafis
have taken central stage in the new Libya. This source adds that these religious
conflicts were largely unknown during Qaddafi's rule.
6. (Source Comment: This source added that the individuals interviewed for the
HRW report were former members of the Libyan Islamist Fighting Group (LIFG), an
Islamist group formed in opposition to Gaddafi's controversial interpretations of Islam.
These LIFO fighters fled the country in the late 198os and went to Afghanistan to join
the fight against the Soviet Union while also gaining training and experience for their
own struggle. A separate source adds that messages to Libya from the CIA and SIS
were found among the Tripoli Documents published by HRW, indicating that the
United States and Britain were eager to help Libya capture several senior LIFG figures,
including its co-founders, Belhaj and Sarni al-Saadi.)
7. As Libyan authorities struggle to control the armed rings that refuse to
surrender weapons following last year's civil war, Salafis, who say Islam should return
to the simple ways followed by Mohammed, have established their own armed gangs in
post-Gaddafi Libya. They view Sufi practices as idolatrous. Since the start of the Arab
Spring uprising across the region, a number of Sufi sites have been attacked in Egypt,
Mali and Libya. Magariaf is determined to establish a democratic state based on
Islamic principles. This individual adds that Magariaf remains dedicated to the idea of
building a tolerant Islamic state in Libya. El Magariafs opinions continue to be shaped
by his experience with Qaddafl, whom he felt built a cult of personality in violation of
all of the basic ideas of Islam.

driven by Human Rights Watch (HRW) and its efforts to tie Western governments to
human rights violations committed under Qaddafi. In this regard HRIAr has
interviewed at least fourteen (14) individuals claiming that they were turned over to
Qaddafi's forces by the Western powers. Belhaj is included in this group.
4. (Source Comment: In the opinion of a very sensitive source, el Magariafs
enemies are working to take advantage of his suspected links to the CIA at a time when
Western intelligence services are under scrutiny in Libya. They also fear that this
situation will only grow more complex as Qaddafi's son Saif al Islam Qaddafi and al
Senousi are brought before Libyan courts to answer for their crimes under the old
regime, particularly during the 2011 revolution. These individuals believe both men
will be linked to Western Intelligence during their trials..)

5. According to this individual, el Magariaf is working with the Muslim
Brotherhood and other Islamist groups to defuse this situation. He is particularly
concerned by the level of violence between Sufi Muslims and Salafists, and believes he
must maintain his reputation for impartiality if he is to defuse this growing problem.
As he works to organize the government, and disarm the militias, he cannot afford to
lose the respect and trust of the Libyan people, especially at a time when cultural
clashes between followers of the mystical Sufi tradition and ultra-conservative Salafis
have taken central stage in the new Libya. This source adds that these religious
conflicts were largely unknown during Qaddafi's rule.
6. (Source Comment: This source added that the individuals interviewed for the
HRW report were former members of the Libyan Islamist Fighting Group (LIFG), an
Islamist group formed in opposition to Gaddafi's controversial interpretations of Islam.
These LIFG fighters fled the country in the late 198os and went to Afghanistan to join
the fight against the Soviet Union while also gaining training and experience for their
own struggle. A separate source adds that messages to Libya from the CIA and SIS
were found among the Tripoli Documents published by HRW, indicating that the
United States and Britain were eager to help Libya capture several senior LIFG figures,
including its co-founders, Belhaj and Sarni al-Saadi.)
7. As Libyan authorities struggle to control the armed rings that refuse to
surrender weapons following last year's civil war, Salafis, who say Islam should return
to the simple ways followed by Mohammed, have established their own armed gangs in
post-Gaddafi Libya. They view Sufi practices as idolatrous. Since the start of the Arab
Spring uprising across the region, a number of Sufi sites have been attacked in Egypt,
Mali and Libya. Magariaf is determined to establish a democratic state based on
Islamic principles. This individual adds that Magariaf remains dedicated to the idea of
building a tolerant Islamic state in Libya. El Magariafs opinions continue to be shaped
by his experience with Qaddafi, whom he felt built a cult of personality in violation of
all of the basic ideas of Islam.

Editor's Note: Stephen Prothero, a Boston University religion scholar and author of ""The American Bible:
How Our Words Unite, Divide, and Define a Nation,"" is a regular CNN Belief Blog contributor.
By Stephen Prothero, Special to CNN
What should we make of the attacks on the U.S. consulates in Egypt, Libya and Yemen, and the deaths of
four Americans, including U.S. ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens?
It depends on who you mean by ""we.""
From the perspective of those who stormed the embassies, taking down the American flag in Egypt and
replacing it with a black flag reading, ""There is no God but Allah and Mohammed is his messenger,"" theirs was
an act of justice on behalf of the One True Faith.
The Americans had it coming, according to this view, because Americans are on the wrong side in the clash of
civilizations between the Judeo-Christian West and the Muslim world. And the creation of an anti-Islamic video
(ironically entitled ""Innocence of Muslims"") by a producer thought to be an American provided the catalyst
(or excuse) for the protests.
Why Muslims are sensitive about portraying the Prophet Mohammed
Most Americans operate by a different ""we."" From our perspective, the assault was an unjust and cowardly
attack on (among other things) the rule of law, the institution of diplomacy and the right of free speech.
Libyan Deputy Prime Minister Mustafa Abushagur gave voice to this perspective when he said on Twitter, ""I
condemn these barbaric attacks in the strongest possible terms. This is an attack on America, Libya and free
people everywhere.""
""Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted on the
Internet,"" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton added. ""The United States deplores any intentional effort to
denigrate the religious beliefs of others. Our commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning
of our nation.""
In a commencement speech at Kenyon College in 2005, later published as""This Is Water,"" novelist David
Foster Wallace urged student to scrutinize the ""natural, basic self-centeredness"" that puts ""me"" at the center of
the world.
This unconscious ""default setting"" fosters the sort of ""blind certainty"" that manifests as arrogant atheism and
fundamentalism alike, Wallace said. And the point of education is to shake us out of that ""default setting"" â€” to
begin to see things from the perspectives of others.

Wallace focused in his speech on the individual ""I."" But his critique can be applied as well to another ""default
setting"" (this one more cultural than natural): our tendency to understand the world from the perspective of
Give:5
According to those who stormed the embassies, ""Innocence of Muslims"" was not made by an individual
(whoever the shadowy ""Sam Bacile"" may â€” or may not â€” be). It was made by anAmerican.
Moreover, according to this groupthink, Americans as a group are responsible for the sins of individual
Americans, so it makes perfect sense to strike out at embassy personnel who issued a statement before the
protests turned deadly, condemning ""the continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious
feelings of Muslims, as we condemn efforts to offend believers of all religions.""
CNN's Belief Blog: The faith angles behind the biggest stories
Meanwhile, the shadowy figures who produced and distributed ""Innocence of Muslims"" are imprisoned in some
groupthink of their own, which gathers all the world's Muslims under the category of an evil Islamic empire.
Their film doesn't just depict Mohammed as a con man, philanderer, and pedophile. It portrays his followers as
dupes.
Unfortunately, the events of recent days have done nothing to jar the alleged producer out of this default setting.
When questioned about his film in the aftermath of the Libyan and Egyptian attacks, a man identifying himself
as ""Sam Bacile"" reportedly told the Wall Street Journal that ""Islam is a cancer.""
You don't need a Kenyon college degree to see how this vicious cycle of provocation and violence is fueled,
and you don't need to be a moral relativist to see that it takes two sides to keep it running.
I am an American who is justly proud of the First Amendment and its protections of freedom of speech and
religion. And I believe that killing your opponents in the name of God or nation is a far greater offense than
offending them with an ignorant movie.
Nonetheless, the root problem on display here is in my view what Wallace denounced as ""blind certainty.""
Our world is not divided first and foremost along religious or national lines, into Muslims and Christians and
Hindus or Israelis and Americans and Egyptians.
Neither is it divided into secularists and people of faith â€” the New Atheists and partisans of old-time religion.
The real ""red line"" in the modem world divides the certain from the uncertain. And in the tragic events of recent
days, those who produced and distributed this hateful movie stand on the same side of this line as the killers of
innocents in Libya and Egypt.
Both groups are possessed by the unholy spirit of ""blind certainty,"" unacquainted with both the complexity and
contradictions of life on Earth and the ""cloud of unknowing"" that hovers over every major religion.
The great religious thinkers in Judaism, Christianity and Islam always knew enough to know that they did not
know everything.
They knew the difference between the eternal decrees of the God of Abraham and the all-too-flawed thoughts of
ordinary people. They knew, in short, that they are not God, who alone is charged with creating and destroying
the world and discriminating along the way between the real and the illusory.
The killers in Libya have forgotten that. So have the not-so-innocent producers and distributors of Innocence
of Islam.""
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Stephen Prothero.

Re: More Magariaf private reax
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the
highest levels of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1.On September 12, 2012 Libyan President Mohammed Yussef el Magariaf told senior
advisors that the death of the U.S. Ambassador at the hands of Islamist militia forces represents a
threat to the future of the newly elected General National Congress (GNC) Government According to
a sensitive source, el Magariaf believes that the primary goal of this and other attacks on Western
facilities is to demonstrate that the GNC cannot protect its non-Islamic friends. Libyan security
officials believe that the attack was carried out by forces of the Islamist militia group calling itself the
Ansar al Sharia brigade; working out of camps in the Eastern suburbs of Benghazi. These officials
added that their sources indicate that this group is led by former members of the old Libyan Islamic
Fighting Group (LIFG), some of whom are loyal to Islamist General Abdelhakirn Belhaj. The same
officials were quick to point out that they have no evidence that Belhaj had any direct involvement in
this attack. They also have no direct information as to whether this assault has anything to do with
the death of Libyan born al Qai'da leader Abu Yahya al- Libi, but they are pursuing this theme. These
officials do believe that the attackers having prepared to launch their assault took advantage of the
cover provided by the demonstrations in Benghazi protesting an internet production seen as
disrespectful to the prophet Mohammed.
2. According to this source, the immediate events were set in motion by a statement made by a
Muslim Cleric in Egypt saying that the internet film was going to be shown across the United States
on September 11 in an effort to insult Muslims on the anniversary of the attacks on the New York
World Trade Center in 2001. This statement inspired increasingly hostile demonstrations at the U.S.

Embassy in Cairo, and at diplomatic facilities in Libya. In Benghazi, reporting from security sources
states, approximately twenty one (21) Ansar al Sharia fighters left their base in East Benghazi just
after sundown infiltrated the crowd of about 2,000 demonstrators at the U.S. Consulate. These
forces, operating under cover of darkness, opened fire on the consulate, eventually setting it on fire
with rocket propelled grenades. These fighters then withdrew to their camp. El Magariaf ordered
security officials to identify and arrest the attackers, adding that he had been in touch with Egyptian
President Mohmmed Morsi, and the two agreed that their intelligence and security personnel will
cooperate in this matter. (Note: Some of the Libyan officials believe that the entire demonstration was
organized as cover for the attack, however; they point out that there is no evidence of such a complex
operation at this time.
3. (Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, Libyan security officers also informed
el Magariaf that the attacks had been planned for approximately one month, based on casing
information obtained during an early demonstration at the U.S. consulate in Benghazi. The attackers
were, in the opinion of these individuals, looking for an opportunity to approach the consulate under
cover in a crowd. These officials add that government security officers admitted to el Magariaf that
they do not have the physical capacity to locate, attack, and destroy the Ansar al-Sharia brigade,
among others. They describe these forces as well-trained, hardened killers; many of whom have spent
time in Afghanistan and Yemen. These fighters are located in camps in Eastern Libya; and Libyan
officials doubt they can penetrate these camps because the militia's are better armed than the forces
of the new National Army.
4. In the opinion of a separate source El Magariaf continues to believe that the attacks were
planned and carried out in a political atmosphere where a portion of the Libyan population is focused
on past cooperation between Western intelligence and security services, and the regime of former
dictator Muammar al Qaddafi. According to this source, el Magariaf realizes that the death of the U.S.
Ambassador dictates that he must find tangible solutions to the problems tied to disarming the
militias, dealing Salafist violence against the followers of Sufi beliefs, and efforts to discredit his
government through linking him to Western intelligence services. El Magariaf instructed his security
officials to cooperate with their U.S. counterparts. He also warned all of his advisors to be prepared
for U.S. retaliation against the suspected perpetrators of this attack, and the angry public reaction that
is sure to follow.
5. (Source Comment: A separate, particularly sensitive source added. that in private
conversation el Magariaf stated that if his government cannot protect a senior diplomatic official,
foreign businesses will not be willing to risk opening up new operations in Libya. According to this
sensitive source, el Magariaf believes that a number of the Islamist militias are now being influenced
al Qai'da and other radical groups; working out of camps in the Eastern and Southeastern parts of the
country. These groups are receiving aid and weapons from supporters in Sudan. In the end, el
Magariaf added that while he does not expect U.S. officials to focus on this point, he believes the
attacks against the interests and citizens of the U.S. and other Western states are aimed first at
overthrowing his government, and replacing it with a strict Islamic Republic dominated by Salafist
leaders. Magariaf also warned that tribal militias loyal to the Qaddafi family continue to present an
equally dangerous threat to the new Government.)

Editor's Note: Stephen Prothero, a Boston University religion scholar and author of ""The American Bible:
How Our Words Unite, Divide, and Define a Nation,"" is a regular CNN Belief Blog contributor.
By Stephen Prothero, Special to CNN
What should we make of the attacks on the U.S. consulates in Egypt, Libya and Yemen, and the deaths of
four Americans, including U.S. ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens?
It depends on who you mean by ""we.""
From the perspective of those who stormed the embassies, taking down the American flag in Egypt and
replacing it with a black flag reading, ""There is no God but Allah and Mohammed is his messenger,"" theirs was
an act of justice on behalf of the One True Faith.
The Americans had it coming, according to this view, because Americans are on the wrong side in the clash of
civilizations between the Judeo-Christian West and the Muslim world. And the creation of an anti-Islamic video
(ironically entitled ""Innocence of Muslims"") by a producer thought to be an American provided the catalyst
(or excuse) for the protests.
Why Muslims are sensitive about portraying the Prophet Mohammed
Most Americans operate by a different ""we."" From our perspective, the assault was an unjust and cowardly
attack on (among other things) the rule of law, the institution of diplomacy and the right of free speech.
Libyan Deputy Prime Minister Mustafa Abushagur gave voice to this perspective when he said on Twitter, ""I
condemn these barbaric attacks in the strongest possible terms. This is an attack on America, Libya and free
people everywhere.""
""Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted on the
Internet,"" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton added. ""The United States deplores any intentional effort to
denigrate the religious beliefs of others. Our commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning
of our nation.""
In a commencement speech at Kenyon College in 2005, later published as""This Is Water,"" novelist David
Foster Wallace urged student to scrutinize the ""natural, basic self-centeredness"" that puts ""me"" at the center of
the world.
This unconscious ""default setting"" fosters the sort of ""blind certainty"" that manifests as arrogant atheism and
fundamentalism alike, Wallace said. And the point of education is to shake us out of that ""default setting"" â€” to
begin to see things from the perspectives of others.

Wallace focused in his speech on the individual ""I."" But his critique can be applied as well to another ""default
setting"" (this one more cultural than natural): our tendency to understand the world from the perspective of
Give:5
According to those who stormed the embassies, ""Innocence of Muslims"" was not made by an individual
(whoever the shadowy ""Sam Bacile"" may â€” or may not â€” be). It was made by anAmerican.
Moreover, according to this groupthink, Americans as a group are responsible for the sins of individual
Americans, so it makes perfect sense to strike out at embassy personnel who issued a statement before the
protests turned deadly, condemning ""the continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious
feelings of Muslims, as we condemn efforts to offend believers of all religions.""
CNN's Belief Blog: The faith angles behind the biggest stories
Meanwhile, the shadowy figures who produced and distributed ""Innocence of Muslims"" are imprisoned in some
groupthink of their own, which gathers all the world's Muslims under the category of an evil Islamic empire.
Their film doesn't just depict Mohammed as a con man, philanderer, and pedophile. It portrays his followers as
dupes.
Unfortunately, the events of recent days have done nothing to jar the alleged producer out of this default setting.
When questioned about his film in the aftermath of the Libyan and Egyptian attacks, a man identifying himself
as ""Sam Bacile"" reportedly told the Wall Street Journal that ""Islam is a cancer.""
You don't need a Kenyon college degree to see how this vicious cycle of provocation and violence is fueled,
and you don't need to be a moral relativist to see that it takes two sides to keep it running.
I am an American who is justly proud of the First Amendment and its protections of freedom of speech and
religion. And I believe that killing your opponents in the name of God or nation is a far greater offense than
offending them with an ignorant movie.
Nonetheless, the root problem on display here is in my view what Wallace denounced as ""blind certainty.""
Our world is not divided first and foremost along religious or national lines, into Muslims and Christians and
Hindus or Israelis and Americans and Egyptians.
Neither is it divided into secularists and people of faith â€” the New Atheists and partisans of old-time religion.
The real ""red line"" in the modem world divides the certain from the uncertain. And in the tragic events of recent
days, those who produced and distributed this hateful movie stand on the same side of this line as the killers of
innocents in Libya and Egypt.
Both groups are possessed by the unholy spirit of ""blind certainty,"" unacquainted with both the complexity and
contradictions of life on Earth and the ""cloud of unknowing"" that hovers over every major religion.
The great religious thinkers in Judaism, Christianity and Islam always knew enough to know that they did not
know everything.
They knew the difference between the eternal decrees of the God of Abraham and the all-too-flawed thoughts of
ordinary people. They knew, in short, that they are not God, who alone is charged with creating and destroying
the world and discriminating along the way between the real and the illusory.
The killers in Libya have forgotten that. So have the not-so-innocent producers and distributors of Innocence
of Islam.""

Re: Lots of new Intel; Libyan army possibly on verge of collapse
Latest:
During the evening of March 27, 2011, individuals with direct access to the military committee of the National
Libyan Council (NLC) stated in confidence that while the rebel forces continue to have organization and
communications problems, their morale has improved drastically, and they believe the Libyan Army is on the
verge of collapse. Under attack from allied Air and Naval forces, the Libyan Army troops have begun to desert
to the rebel side in increasing numbers. The rebels are making an effort togeet these troops as fellow Libyans,
in an effort to encourage additional defections.
(Source Comment: Speaking in strict confidence, one rebel commander stated that his troops continue to
summarily execute all foreign mercenaries captured in the fighting. At the same time Colonel Khalifa Haftzuâ€¢
has reportedly joined the rebel command structure, in an effort to help organization the rebel forces. Haftar was
the commander of the Libyan National Army ([NA), a 1500 man force of anti-Qaddafi troops based in
N'djamena, Chad, until current President Idryss Debi overthrew Chadian President Hussein Habre in the fall of
1990, with the assistance of Libyan and French troops. Haftar and his troops lied to a cotaatry in central Africa
and many, including Haftar, later settled in the United States.)
An extremely sensitive source added that the rebels are receiving direct assistance and training from a small
number of Egyptian Special Forces units, while French and British Special Operations troops are working out of
bases in Egypt, along the Libyan border. These troops are overseeing the transfer of weapons and supplies to
the rebels.

(Source Comment: The rebels are moving back into 'areas that they lost in mid- March fighting, and using the
allied air cover, they are confident they can move into the Tripoli district in a matter of days. One rebel source
reported that they had reliable intelligence that people were evacuating Qaddafi's hometown, Sirte, anticipating
its capture by the rebels. Sirte is located mid-way between Tripoli and Benghazi; its loss will be a
psychological blow for Qaddall.)
Separately, a sensitive European source stated in strict confidence that French military commanders anticipate a
complete collapse of the Libyan military command and control structure in the next week. These officers, who
have experience with the Libyan Army during its invasion of Chad in the late 1980s stated that the Libyan
troops did not perform well under concentrated fire from troops armed with modern weapons.
This source also noted that information from Tripoli has become increasingly difficult to obtain, but there are
reports of deaths among some Qaddafi's senior security officials, including Mansour Daw, and that the Libyan
leader himself may have experienced a health problem. Unfortunately, the European Intelligence services have
been unable to confirm or discredit these reports. This situation has become increasingly frustrating for French
President Nicolas Sarkozy, who, according to knowledgeable individuals, is pressing to have France emerge
from this crisis as the principal foreign ally of any new government that takes power.
Sarkozy is also concerned about continuing reports that radical/terrorist groups such as the Libyan Fighting
Groups and Al Qa'ida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) are infiltrating the NLC. and its military command.
Accordingly, he asked sociologist who has long established ties to Israel, Syria, and other B6
nations in the Middle East, to use his contacts to determine the level of influence AQIM and other terrorist
groups have inside of the NLC. Sarkozy also asked for reports setting out a clear picture of the role of the
Muslim Brotherhood in the rebel leadership.
These sources note that French diplomats and intelligence officers in Egypt are in contact with the following
rebel figures in Benghazi:
MESMAR1Nouri (Qaddafi's former head of protocol, who along with Mousa Kousa was considered the Libyan
leaders most loyal follower. Noun currently lives in France;
.Gehan (GI-LEI-LAND Abdallah (colonel);
CHARRA.NT Faraj,
BOUKHRIS Fathi,
General Abdelfateh Younis (commander of the rebel forces)
(Source Comment: Senior European security officials caution that AQIM is watching developments in Libya,
and elements of that organization have been in touch with tribes in the southeastern part of the country. These
officials are concerned that in a post-Qaddafi Libya, France and other western European countries must move
quickly to ensure that the new government does not allow AQUA and others to set up small, semi- autonomous
local entitiesâ€”or ""Caliphates""â€”in the oil and gas producing regions of southeastern Libya.)
These knowledgeable sources add that the insurgents have the following weapons stockpiled in Benghazi:
82 and 120 mm. mortars;
GPZ type machine guns;
12.7mm. machine guns mounted on 4x4 vehicles;
some anti-aircraft batteries type ZSU 23/2 and 23/4 as well as Man-Portable Air-Defense Systems
(MANPADS) type SAM?;
some tanks type T-72;

French, British and Egyptian Special Forces troops are training the rebels inside of western Egypt, and to a
limited degree in the western suburbs of Benghazi.

Status update on the Chris Stevens mission to Benghazi:
The current game plan is for Mr. Stevens to move no later than Wednesday from Malta to Benghazi. He will stage off
shore initially for a one day visit during which he will have meetings with TNC interlocutors and get a sense of the
situation on the ground. The goal of this one day trip is for him to lay the groundwork for a stay of up to 30 days.
He will be accompanied by a DS team, a staff member from Embassy Tripoli and the leader of USAID's DART team. With
the support of Ambassador Cretz and Embassy Tripoli, Mr Stevens is in contact with TNC members on the ground in
Benghazi and elsewhere; the team is also in contact with other diplomatic missions and NGOs in Benghazi. We expect to
get support in particular from the Turks who have a consulate in Benghazi.
Mr. Stevens team has been in touch with Africom planners on the details of the mission. We have made the official
request for support from OSD but have yet to get approval. Once we have that â€” and we hope that will be very soon --
we will be able to move forward with the planning.

Hillary Clinton tries to calm anti-U.S.
sentiment as protesters storm embassy
in Yemen

September 13, 11:06 AM
Secretary of State Hillary Rodharn Clinton on Thursday tried to distance the U.S.
government from a movie that has sparked protests throughout the Muslim world,
calling it ""disgusting and reprehensible"" but also condemning efforts to avenge the
movie through bloodshed.

""The U.S. government has absolutely nothing to do with this video. We absolutely
reject its content and messages,"" Clinton said. ""But there is no justification none
at all â€” for responding to this video with violence.""
Clinton spoke two days after U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three
other Americans were killed at the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, an attack
that analysts was staged by militants to coincide with a demonstration against the
controversial movie. Protests denouncing the film have raged outside the U.S
Embassy in Egypt for three days, and demonstrators on Tuesday breached the walls
of that heavily guarded compound, pulled down an American flag and destroyed it.
In Sanaa, Yemen, hundreds of demonstrators converged on a usually-sealed-off
street in front of the embassy on Thursday for a protest that also turned violent,
witnesses said. Protesters stormed a wall, set fire to a building inside the compound,
broke windows and carried away office supplies and other souvenirs before being
pushed back and dispersed by Yemeni security forces.
""We want to expel the American ambassador,"" said Abdelwadood al-Mutawa, a
protester who was walking out of the embassy compound. He said he was
motivated by reports of the movie mocking the prophet Muhammad. ""We cannot
accept any insult to our prophet,"" Mutawa said. ""It's a red line.""
Another protester said that some of the security forces protecting the building
appeared sympathetic to the demonstrators' cause. ""Some soldiers were telling me,
'These are dogs, and we cannot accept insulting our prophet,' ""said Yusef
Mohammad.
Smaller protests were reported in front of diplomatic offices in Iran and outside a
mosque in Bangladesh.
Yemen's president, Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, quickly issued an apology to the
United States, and ordered an investigation into incident.
""The Government of Yemen condemns any and all acts of violence against
diplomatic personnel and facilities,"" a statement from Yemen's government said.
""We strongly urge all those that would wish to incite others to violence to cease
immediately.""
But the violence in Yemen again raised questions about whether vulnerable Middle
East governments are willing or even able to protect American targets in their

countries. It was a further measure of the depth of anger about the film insulting the
prophet Muhammad, which was reportedly made in California, although much
about its origins remains unknown.
President Obama spoke by phone with Libyan President Mohamed Yusuf al-
Magariaf late Wednesday, accepting condolences for the American deaths in
Benghazi and expressing appreciation for the cooperation between the United States
and the people and government of Libya in the wake of the attack, the White House
said.
In Brussels, meanwhile, Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi on Thursday gave his
strongest condemnation yet of the attack on the Cairo embassy. He had issued only
tepid statements on Wednesday, and his Muslim Brotherhood organization had
called for further protests in front of the diplomatic compound.
Morsi said he condemned the security breach ""in the clearest terms.""
""I assured Barack Obama that we will not permit any attacks"" on U.S. diplomatic
compounds across Egypt, said Morsi, who is in Belgium for a visit to the European
Union.
But Morsi also denounced the anti-Islamic film that appears to have sparked many
of the protests, adding that he had spoken to Obama about it. ""I called him to ask
him to put an end to such behavior,"" Morsi said, referring to the making of the film.
In her remarks, made in Washington during an appearance with the Moroccan
foreign minister, Clinton said the United States cannot and should not prevent
people from making films that express their opinions. Doing so, she emphasized,
would violate the country's staunch commitment to free and open speech.
""Now I know it is hard for some people to understand why the United States cannot
or does not just prevent these kinds of reprehensible videos from ever seeing the
light of day,"" Clinton said. ""... Even if it were possible, our country does have a
long tradition of free expression, which is enshrined in our Constitution and our
law. And we do not stop individual citizens from expressing their views, no matter
how distasteful they may be.""
Noting that countless generations of immigrants, including ""millions of Muslims""
have left other countries for the United States in order to enjoy those same

freedoms, Clinton repeatedly denounced violent responses to offensive speech. She
called on other world leaders to do the same.
""We all -- whether we are leaders in goverment, leaders in civil society or
religious leaders -- must draw the line at violence,"" Clinton said. ""And any
responsible leader should be standing up now and drawing that line.""
In Cairo on Thursday, security forces eventually pushed the demonstrators away
from the U.S. Embassy onto Tahrir Square â€” the crucial site of Egypt's 2011
revolution.
In Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital, about 100 demonstrators burned an American
flag and chanted slogans on Thursday, including ""We won't accept mocking of
Prophet Muhammad"" and ""Down with American imperialism,"" Agence France
Press reported.
The news agency said the protesters were mostly seminary student. They gathered
outside the Baitul Mokarram Mosque, the largest in the country, but called for more
protests Friday and said the U.S. embassy could be the target. Bangladeshi police
told AFP that security at the embassy was being enhanced.
In Tehran, anti-American protesters gathered outside the Swiss Embassy, which
represents U.S. interests in Iran CNN reported. The United States does not have an
embassy in Iran.

From Sid
Re: Lots of new Intel; Libyan army possibly on verge of collapse
Latest:
During the evening of March 27, 2011, individuals with direct access to the military committee of the National
Libyan Council (NLC) stated in confidence that while the rebel forces continue to have organization and
communications problems, their morale has improved drastically, and they believe the Libyan Army is on the
verge of collapse. Under attack from allied Air and Naval forces, the Libyan Army troops have begun to desert
to the rebel side in increasing numbers. The rebels are making an effort togeet these troops as fellow Libyans,
in an effort to encourage additional defections.
(Source Comment: Speaking in strict confidence, one rebel commander stated that his troops continue to
summarily execute all foreign mercenaries captured in the fighting. At the same time Colonel Khalifa Haftzuâ€¢
has reportedly joined the rebel command structure, in an effort to help organization the rebel forces. Haftar was
the commander of the Libyan National Army ([NA), a 1500 man force of anti-Qaddafi troops based in
N'djamena, Chad, until current President Idryss Debi overthrew Chadian President Hussein Habre in the fall of
1990, with the assistance of Libyan and French troops. Haftar and his troops lied to a cotaatry in central Africa
and many, including Haftar, later settled in the United States.)
An extremely sensitive source added that the rebels are receiving direct assistance and training from a small
number of Egyptian Special Forces units, while French and British Special Operations troops are working out of
bases in Egypt, along the Libyan border. These troops are overseeing the transfer of weapons and supplies to
the rebels.

(Source Comment: The rebels are moving back into 'areas that they lost in mid- March fighting, and using the
allied air cover, they are confident they can move into the Tripoli district in a matter of days. One rebel source
reported that they had reliable intelligence that people were evacuating Qaddafi's hometown, Sirte, anticipating
its capture by the rebels. Sirte is located mid-way between Tripoli and Benghazi; its loss will be a
psychological blow for Qaddall.)
Separately, a sensitive European source stated in strict confidence that French military commanders anticipate a
complete collapse of the Libyan military command and control structure in the next week. These officers, who
have experience with the Libyan Army during its invasion of Chad in the late 1980s stated that the Libyan
troops did not perform well under concentrated fire from troops armed with modern weapons.
This source also noted that information from Tripoli has become increasingly difficult to obtain, but there are
reports of deaths among some Qaddafi's senior security officials, including Mansour Daw, and that the Libyan
leader himself may have experienced a health problem. Unfortunately, the European Intelligence services have
been unable to confirm or discredit these reports. This situation has become increasingly frustrating for French
President Nicolas Sarkozy, who, according to knowledgeable individuals, is pressing to have France emerge
from this crisis as the principal foreign ally of any new government that takes power.
Sarkozy is also concerned about continuing reports that radical/terrorist groups such as the Libyan Fighting
Groups and Al Qa'ida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) are infiltrating the NLC. and its military command.
Accordingly, he asked sociologist who has long established ties to Israel, Syria, and other B6
nations in the Middle East, to use his contacts to determine the level of influence AQIM and other terrorist
groups have inside of the NLC. Sarkozy also asked for reports setting out a clear picture of the role of the
Muslim Brotherhood in the rebel leadership.
These sources note that French diplomats and intelligence officers in Egypt are in contact with the following
rebel figures in Benghazi:
MESMAR1Nouri (Qaddafi's former head of protocol, who along with Mousa Kousa was considered the Libyan
leaders most loyal follower. Noun currently lives in France;
.Gehan (GI-LEI-LAND Abdallah (colonel);
CHARRA.NT Faraj,
BOUKHRIS Fathi,
General Abdelfateh Younis (commander of the rebel forces)
(Source Comment: Senior European security officials caution that AQIM is watching developments in Libya,
and elements of that organization have been in touch with tribes in the southeastern part of the country. These
officials are concerned that in a post-Qaddafi Libya, France and other western European countries must move
quickly to ensure that the new government does not allow AQUA and others to set up small, semi- autonomous
local entitiesâ€”or ""Caliphates""â€”in the oil and gas producing regions of southeastern Libya.)
These knowledgeable sources add that the insurgents have the following weapons stockpiled in Benghazi:
82 and 120 mm. mortars;
GPZ type machine guns;
12.7mm. machine guns mounted on 4x4 vehicles;
some anti-aircraft batteries type ZSU 23/2 and 23/4 as well as Man-Portable Air-Defense Systems
(MANPADS) type SAM?;
some tanks type T-72;

American Killed in Libya Was on Intel Mission to Track Weapons
Before Death, Ex-SEAL Glen Doherty Told ABC News He Helped Round Up Dangerous
Shoulder-Fired Rockets
By LEE FERRAN
Sept. 13,2012
One of the Americans killed alongside Ambassador Christopher Stevens in an attack on a U.S. diplomatic
mission in Libya Tuesday told ABC News before his death that he was working with the State Department
on an intelligence mission to round up dangerous weapons in the war-torn nation.
In an interview with ABC News last month, Glen Doherty, a 42-year-old former Navy SEAL who worked as
a contractor with the State Department, said he personally went into the field to track down so-called
MANPADS, shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles, and destroy them. After the fall of dictator Moammar
Gadhafi last year, the State Department launched a mission to round up thousands of MANPADS that may
have been looted from military installations across the country. U.S. officials previously told ABC
News they were concerned the MANPADS could fall into the hands of terrorists, creating a threat to
commercial airliners.

Doherty said that he traveled throughout Libya chasing reports of the weapons and once they were found,
his team would destroy them on the spot by bashing them with hammers or repeatedly running them over
with their vehicles. When ABC News spoke to Doherty in late August, he was enjoying a short time off in
California before heading back to Libya just days ago.

The State Department declined to comment on Doherty's involvement in the IVIANPADS program, but
pointed to a previous statement from State Assistant Secretary for Political-Military Affairs Andrew
Shapiro in which he said the department was looking at ""every possible tool to mitigate the threat.""
According to military records provided to ABC News, Doherty joined the Navy in 1996 and was a combat
medic and a decorated member of the elite SEAL teams by the time he left active duty in 2004. He's
described in glowing terms as a top-tier SEAL and better friend in the book ""The Red Circle,"" written by
Doherty's longtime friend and SEAL sniper school partner, Brandon Webb.
""Glen was a superb and respected operator, a true quiet professional,"" Webb told ABC News today. ""Don't
feel sorry for him, he wouldn't have it. He died serving with men he respected, protecting the freedoms we
enjoy as Americans and doing something he loved. He was my best friend and one of the finest human
beings I've ever known.""
Doherty's mother, Barbara, told ABC News' Boston affiliate WCVB she had been notified of her son's death
late Wednesday.
""He was the most wonderful person,"" she said. ""We are all in pain and suffering.""
Ambassador Stevens and State Department information management officer Sean Smith were killed in the
first wave of attacks in Benghazi when the building they were in was set on fire around 10 p.m. local time
Tuesday, a senior administration official told reporters. Doherty was apparently one of two other
Americans who were killed in a firefight nearly two hours later, while the facility was still under attack.
The State Department has not officially released the names of those Americans.

GOP's October surprise?
They're calling it the ""Jimmy Carter Strategy"": Exploit
Libya attack to paint Obama as weak on terrorism
By cY'aia?,_
(Credit: AP/AI Behrman/Salort)
According to a highly reliable source, as Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama prepare for the
first presidential debate Wednesday night, top Republican operatives are primed to unleash a new
two-pronged offensive that will attack Obama as weak on national security, and will be based, in part,
on inW !ia:en,y-.3iTeForrnation regarding the attacks in Libya that killed U.S. ambassador Chris
Stevens on September
The source, who has first-hand knowledge of private, high-level conversations in the Romney tamp
that took place in Washington, DC last week, said that at various times the GOP strategists referred to
their new operation as the Jimmy Carter Strategy or the October Surprise.
He added that they planned to release what they hoped would be ""a bombshell"" that would make
Libya and Obama's foreign policy a major issue in the campaign. ""My understanding is that they have
come up with evidence that the Obama administration had positive intelligence that there was going
to be a terrorist attack on the intelligence.""
The source described the Republicans as chortling with glee that the Obama administration
""definitely had intel"" about the attack before it happened. ""Intelligence can be graded in different
ways,"" he added, ""and sometimes A and B don't get connected. But [the Romney campaign] will try to
paint it to look like Obama had advance knowledge of the attack and is weak on terrorism.""
He said they were jubilant about their new strategy and said they intended to portray Obama as a
helpless, Jimmy Carter-like president and to equate the tragedy in Libya with President Carter's failed
attempt to rescue American hostages in Iran in t980. ""They are so excited about it,"" he said. ""Over
and over again they talked about bow it would be just like Jimmy Carter's failed raid. They feel it is
going to give them .a last-minute landslide in the election.""
The source, however, said lie was dubious about the tactic. ""To me, it is indicative that they have lost
touch with a huge portion of the electorate,"" he said.
The source declined to reveal the names of the GOP operatives who were present. But he said, ""These
were the top guys in the party. It was a .private, unguarded planning conversation."" He further

described participants in the meeting as consisting of well-known names tied to the big Republican
super PACs and people who had access to high-level national security intelligence.
""As usual, Karl Rove wasn't present,"" he said, ""but some were close to Rove.""
The source said that ""there was quite a bit more"" to the operation than simply revealing the
intelligence regarding Libya. He declined to discuss what he described as the second phase of the
operation.
However, already there is evidence that the first phase of the operation is underway. On Wednesday,
September 26, on Fox News, Karl Rove called Obama's reaction to what happened in Libya
""inexplicable"" and added that Obama is ""more intent on campaigning than meeting his
responsibilities as commander-in-chief."" He went on to warn that Obama's policies in Libya
endangered the U.S. with regard to Iran. ""I am astonished,"" Rove said. ""We are projecting weakness
when we need to be projecting strength.""
Similarly, former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a one-time GOP presidential hopeful who
became known as the mayor of 9/11, followed Rove in criticizing Obama on the attack in Libya. ""This
is a deliberate attempt to cover up the truth, from an administration that claimed it wanted to be the
most transparent in history,"" he told Fox News. ""And it's the worst kind of cover-up: the kind of
cover-up that involves our national security. This is a cover-up that involves the slaughter of four
Americans.""
Giuliani added that the Obama White House wanted to dismiss the role played by al-Qaeda because it
seemed to diminish the triumph of having killed Osama bin Laden. ""I think it's because they have this
narrative that they defeated al-Qaeda,"" he said. ""They never say the words 'Islamic fundamentalist
terrorism'. They want to wish it away. The president was moving on to Asia â€” he was going to declare
this a great victory for himself and unfortunately, this terrible act of terror intervened in their very
convenient narrative.""
Likewise, Bob Corker, Republican senator from Tennessee, described the administration's response to
""the terrorist attack"" in Libya as And on Sunday, September 30, both Mitt Romney and
vice-presidential nominee Paul Ryan joined in the attacks. ""I think they want to do their very best to
keep the people of America from understanding exactly what happened. We expect candor, we expect
transparency, particularly as it relates to terrorism,"" Romney said.
Added Ryan, ""Why is he (Obama) not on the same page with his own administration officials who are
saying that this is a terrorist attack? We'll leave it up to you to decide whether it's a cover-up or not.""
In an apparently related development, a Politico artkle posted last night said Romney advisers were
divided over hovv aggressively to attack President Obama over his handling of the events in Libya. One
unnamed Romney adviser described them as ""a huge gift"" to the campaign. ""Across the board â€”
domestic, economic and foreign-policy issues â€” President Obama has been outmatched by events,"" he
said. ""He's an observer of events, not a shaper of events. Everywhere you look, he's been outmatched.""
But other Romney advisers, led by media strategist Stuart Stevens, wanted to stick to the economy as
the central issue. ""They'll tell you that you've got to focus people on the fact that their economic
prospects are not very good and all that,"" the aide told Politico. ""Well, Romney's been trying to do that
now since he clinched the nomination at the end of April â€” and he's failed. The president is better at
deflecting attention from the bad news than Romney is at driving home the impact of the bad news on
individual voters.""

Statement on the Attack in Benghazi
September 11, 2012
I condemn in the strongest terms the attack on our mission in Benghazi today. As we work to
secure our personnel and facilities, we have confirmed that one of our State Department officers
was killed. We are heartbroken by this terrible loss. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family
and those who have suffered in this attack.
This evening, I called Libyan President Magariaf to coordinate additional support to protect
Americans in Libya. President Magariaf expressed his condemnation and condolences and
pledged his government's full cooperation.
Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted
on the Internet The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs
of others. Our commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation.
But let me be clear: There is never any justification for violent acts of this kind.
In light of the events of today, the United States government is working with partner countries
around the world to protect our personnel, our missions, and American citizens worldwide.
Statement on the Death of American Personnel in Benghazi, Libya
September 12, 2012
It is with profound sadness that I share the news of the death of four American personnel in
Benghazi, Libya yesterday. Among them were United States Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens
and Foreign Service Information Management Officer, Sean Smith. We are still making next of
kin notifications for the other two individuals. Our hearts go out to all their families and
colleagues.
A 21 year veteran of the Foreign Service, Ambassador Stevens died last night from injuries he
sustained in the attack on our office in Benghazi.
I had the privilege of swearing in Chris for his post in Libya only a few months ago. He spoke
eloquently about his passion for service, for diplomacy and for the Libyan people. This
assignment was only the latest in his more than two decades of dedication to advancing closer
ties with the people of the Middle East and North Africa which began as a Peace Corps
Volunteer in Morocco. As the conflict in Libya unfolded, Chris was one of the first Americans
on the ground in Benghazi. He risked his own life to lend the Libyan people a helping hand to
build the foundation for a new, free nation. He spent every day since helping to finish the work
that he started. Chris was committed to advancing America's values and interests, even when
that meant putting himself in danger.
Sean Smith was a husband and a father of two, who joined the Department ten years ago. Like

Chris. Sean was one of our best. Prior to arriving in Benghazi, he served in Baghdad, Pretoria,
Montreal, and most recently The Hague.
All the Americans we lost in yesterday's attacks made the ultimate sacrifice. We condemn this
vicious and violent attack that took their lives, which they had committed to helping the Libyan
people reach for a better future.
America's diplomats and development experts stand on the front lines every day for our country.
We are honored by the service of each and every one of them.
Remarks on the Deaths of American Personnel in Benghazi, Libya
September 12, 2012
Yesterday, our U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya was attacked. Heavily armed militants
assaulted the compound and set fire to our buildings. American and Libyan security personnel
battled the attackers together. Four Americans were killed. They included Sean Smith, a Foreign
Service information management officer, and our Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens. We are
still making next of kin notifications for the other two individuals.
This is an attack that should shock the conscience of people of all faiths around the world. We
condemn in the strongest terms this senseless act of violence, and we send our prayers to the
families, friends, and colleagues of those we've lost.
All over the world, every day, America's diplomats and development experts risk their lives in
the service of our country and our values, because they believe that the United States must be a
force for peace and progress in the world, that these aspirations are worth striving and sacrificing
for. Alongside our men and women in uniform, they represent the best traditions of a bold and
generous nation.
In the lobby of this building, the State Department, the names of those vvho have fallen in the line
of duty are inscribed in marble. Our hearts break over each one. And now, because of this
tragedy, we have new heroes to honor and more friends to mourn.
Chris Stevens fell in love with the Middle East as a young Peace Corps volunteer teaching
English in Morocco. He joined the Foreign Service, learned languages, won friends for America
in distant places, and made other people's hopes his own.
In the early days of the Libyan revolution, I asked Chris to be our envoy to the rebel opposition.
He arrived on a cargo ship in the port of Benghazi and began building our relationships with
Libya's revolutionaries. He risked his life to stop a tyrant, then gave his life trying to help build a
better Libya. The world needs more Chris Stevenses. I spoke with his sister, Ann, this morning,
and told her that he will be remembered as a hero by many nations.

Sean Smith was an Air Force veteran. He spent 10 years as an information management officer
in the State Department, he was posted at The Hague, and was in Libya on a brief temporary
assignment. He was a husband to his wife Heather, with whom I spoke this morning. He was a
father to two young children, Samantha and Nathan. They will grow up being proud of the
service their father gave to our country, service that took him from Pretoria to Baghdad, and
finally to Benghazi.
The mission that drew Chris and Sean and their colleagues to Libya is both noble and necessary,
and we and the people of Libya honor their memory by carrying it forward. This is not easy.
Today, many Americans are asking -- indeed, I asked myself how could this happen? How
could this happen in a country we helped liberate, in a city we helped save from destruction?
This question reflects just how complicated and, at times, how confounding the world can be.
But we must be clear-eyed, even in our grief. This was an attack by a small and savage group â€”
not the people or Government of Libya. Everywhere Chris and his team went in Libya, in a
country scarred by war and tyranny, they were hailed as friends and partners. And when the
attack came yesterday, Libyans stood and fought to defend our post. Some were wounded.
Libyans carried Chris' body to the hospital, and they helped rescue and lead other Americans to
safety. And last night, when I spoke with the President of Libya, he strongly condemned the
violence and pledged every effort to protect our people and pursue those responsible.
The friendship between our countries, borne out of shared struggle, will not be another casualty
of this attack. A free and stable Libya is still in America's interest and security, and we will not
turn our back on that, nor will we rest until those responsible for these attacks are found and
brought to justice. We are working closely with the Libyan authorities to move swiftly and
surely. We are also working with partners around the world to safeguard other American
embassies, consulates, and citizens.
There will be more time later to reflect, but today, we have work to do. There is no higher
priority than protecting our men and women wherever they serve. We are working to determine
the precise motivations and methods of those who carried out this assault. Some have sought to
justify this vicious behavior, along with the protest that took place at our Embassy in Cairo
yesterday, as a response to inflammatory material posted on the intemet. America's commitment
to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation. But let me be clear â€” there is
no justification for this, none. Violence like this is no way to honor religion or faith. And as long
as there are those who would take innocent life in the name of God, the world will never know a
true and lasting peace.
It is especially difficult that this happened on September 1 1th It's an anniversary that means a
great deal to all Americans. Every year on that day, we are reminded that our work is not yet
finished, that the job of putting an end to violent extremism and building a safe and stable world
continues. But September 11th means even more than that. it is a day on which we remember

Statement on the Deaths of Tyrone S. Woods and Glen A. Doherty in Benghazi, Libya
September 13, 2012
The attack on our diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya on Tuesday claimed the lives of four
Americans. Yesterday, I spoke about two: Ambassador Chris Stevens and Information
Management Officer Sean Smith. Today, we also recognize the two security personnel who died
helping protect their colleagues. Tyrone S. Woods and Glen A. Doherty were both decorated
military veterans who served our country with honor and distinction. Our thoughts, prayers, and
deepest gratitude are with their families and friends. Our embassies could not carry on our
critical work around the world without the service and sacrifice of brave people like Tyrone and
Glen.
Tyrone's friends and colleagues called him ""Rone,"" and they relied on his courage and skill,
honed over two decades as a Navy SEAL. In uniform, he served multiple tours in Iraq and
Afghanistan. Since 2010, he protected American diplomatic personnel in dangerous posts from
Central America to the Middle East. He had the hands of a healer as well as the arm of a warrior,
earning distinction as a registered nurse and certified paramedic. All our hearts go out to
Tyrone's wife Dorothy and his three sons, Tyrone Jr., Hunter, and Kai, who was born just a few
months ago.
We also grieve for Glen Doherty, called Bub, and his family: his father Bernard, his mother
Barbara, his brother Gregory, and his sister Kathleen. Glen was also a former Navy SEAL and an
experienced paramedic. And he put his life on the line many times, protecting Americans in Iraq,
Afghanistan, and other hotspots. In the end, he died the way he lived â€” with selfless honor and
unstinting valor.
We condemn the attack that took the lives of these heroes in the strongest terms, and we are
taking additional steps to safeguard American embassies, consulates, and citizens around the
world. This violence should shock the conscience of people of all faiths and traditions. We
appreciate the statements of support that have poured in from across the region and beyond.

People of conscience and goodwill everywhere must stand together in these difficult days against
violence, hate, and division.
I am enormously proud of the men and women who risk their lives every day in the service of
our country and our values. They help make the United States the greatest force for peace,
progress, and human dignity that the world has ever known. We honor the memory of our fallen
colleagues by continuing their work and carrying on the best traditions of a bold and generous
nation.
Remarks at theOpening Plenary of the U.S.-Morocco Strategic Dialogue
September 13, 2012
SECRETARY CLINTON: Good morning. Well, let me welcome our friends and colleagues
from Morocco here to the Benjamin Franklin Room on the eighth floor of the State Department
for this very important first session of the U.S.-Morocco Strategic Dialogue. Before I begin to
address the significance of this Strategic Dialogue and the next step in our long relations with
Morocco, I want to say a few words about the events unfolding in the world today.
We are closely watching what is happening in Yemen and elsewhere, and we certainly hope and
expect that there will be steps taken to avoid violence and prevent the escalation of protests into
violence.
I also want to take a moment to address the video circulating on the Internet that has led to these
protests in a number of countries. Let me state very clearly and I hope it is obvious -- that the
United States Government had absolutely nothing to do with this video. We absolutely reject its
content and message. America's commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very
beginning of our nation. And as you know, we are home to people of all religions, many of
whom came to this country seeking the right to exercise their own religion, including, of course,
millions of Muslims. And we have the greatest respect for people of faith.
To us, to me personally, this video is disgusting and reprehensible. It appears to have a deeply
cynical purpose: to denigrate a great religion and to provoke rage. But as I said yesterday, there
is no justification, none at all, for responding to this video with violence. We condemn the
violence that has resulted in the strongest terms, and we greatly appreciate that many Muslims in
the United States and around the world have spoken out on this issue.
Violence, we believe, has no place in religion and is no way to honor religion. Islam, like other
religions, respects the fundamental dignity of human beings, and it is a violation of that
fundamental dignity to wage attacks on innocents. As long as there are those who are willing to
shed blood and take innocent life in the name of religion, the name of God, the world will never
know a true and lasting peace. It is especially wrong for violence to be directed against
diplomatic missions, These are places whose very purpose is peaceful: to promote better
understanding across countries and cultures. All governments have a responsibility to protect

those spaces and people, because to attack an embassy is to attack the idea that we can work
together to build understanding and a better future.
Now, I know it is hard for some people to understand why the United States cannot or does not
just prevent these kinds of reprehensible videos from ever seeing the light of day. Now, I would
note that in today's world with today's technologies, that is impossible. But even if it were
possible, our country does have a long tradition of free expression which is enshrined in our
Constitution and our law, and we do not stop individual citizens from expressing their views no
matter how distasteful they may be.
There are, of course, different views around the world about the outer limits of free speech and
free expression, but there should be no debate about the simple proposition that violence in
response to speech is not acceptable. We all â€” whether we are leaders in government, leaders in
civil society or religious leaders â€” must draw the line at violence. And any responsible leader
should be standing up now and drawing that line.
I wanted to begin with this statement, because, as our Moroccan friends and all of you know, this
has been a difficult week at the State Department. I very much appreciate, Minister, the
condolences your government expressed to our Embassy in Rabat. And even though that tragedy
happened far away in Benghazi, we found a reminder of the deep bounds that connect Morocco
to the United States. It was in the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco that one of the Americans
we lost this week, Ambassador Chris Stevens, fell in love with the region when he served as a
Peace Corps volunteer there. That experience set him on a decades-long career of service. So in
the memory of fallen friends and colleagues, let us remind ourselves of the many ways in which
not just our governments but the people of our two nations have worked together to build a better
future.
In many ways, the United States looks to Morocco to be a leader and a model. His Majesty King
Mohammed deserves great credit for the work you've undertaken. In fact, after my visit to Rabat
earlier this year, I told my team: ""We need to start a Strategic Dialogue with Morocco."" No
country has been a friend of the United States longer than Morocco. You were the first nation to
recognize us back in 1777. But we're not satisfied with simply having a friendship that is
longstanding. We want one that is dynamic, growing, looking toward the future. So let me
highlight a few of the areas we should focus on today.
On political reform, we have all seen remarkable changes taking place across North Africa and
the Middle East. I commend Morocco and your government for your efforts to stay ahead of
these changes by holding free and fair elections, empowering the elected parliament, taking other
steps to ensure that the government reflects the will of the people. Today, our political working
group will discuss how the United States can continue to support your efforts to translate
commitments into actions. Because as we all know, democracy, real reform, require that people
themselves feel the changes in their everyday lives: the courts reformed, the goverment more

open and transparent, universal human rights of all Moroccans -- men and women alike â€”
respected.
I'm especially pleased by Morocco's commitments to take on the deeply troubling problem of
child marriage. We know that child brides are less likely to get an education, more likely to face
life-threatening problems, particularly around child birth and delivery, which not only
shortchanges them but can even rob them and their communities of their lives and talents. So we
want to encourage the government and civil society to continue their important work together on
this issue.
With regard to the Western Sahara, the United States continues to support efforts to find a
peaceful, sustainable, mutually agreed-upon solution. U.S. policy toward the Western Sahara has
remained consistent for many years. We have made clear that Morocco's autonomy plan is
serious, realistic, and credible, and that it represents a potential approach that could satisfy the
aspirations of the people in the Western Sahara to run their own affairs in peace and dignity. We
continue to support the negotiations carried out by the United Nations and hope parties can work
toward resolution.
With respect to the economy, our second working group will focus on what more can be done to
deliver tangible economic benefits. Morocco's economy is relatively healthy, but you face the
same problem that is now endemic across the world â€” unemployment is still too high, especially
among young people.
That's why the United States is providing $1.5 million to support an effart to attract foreign
investors, foster local economic development, and combat corruption across the region. And I'm
pleased to announce that later this year we will hold a Morocco business development
conference here in Washington to connect businesses from both countries.
'Today, we should discuss ways to build on all of these efforts by increasing bilateral trade, a
particular goal of mine since so much trade from Morocco goes to Europe. I'd like to increase
the amount of trade coming to the United States, and also to improve economic integration
across North Africa, which could greatly benefit Morocco because of Morocco's stability and
Morocco's very strong economic foundation. The greater integration there is, the greater the
benefits for Moroccans.
Third, the attack in Benghazi this week reminds us that security remains a vital issue. Through
our work together on the Global Counterterrorism Task Force, the United States and Morocco
already share crucial information and best practices, and I thank Morocco for hosting a Global
Counterterrorism Task Force workshop on threats in the South Atlantic next month.

We are also collaborating through USAID, the Peace Corps, and other agencies to help provide
Moroccan youth with alternatives to criminal and extremist organizations. And so we are
partnering to help strengthen Morocco's criminal justice system and law enforcement.
There will be a lot to discuss in the meeting today. And let me add, the United States greatly
appreciates the constructive role Morocco is playing on the UN Security Council, especially your
support for the effort to end the violence and bloodshed in Syria and help to usher in a new
democratic future for that country. I commend Morocco for offering to host the next ministerial
meeting of the Friends of the Syrian People, and we look forward to continuing to work closely
together as close partners even after your term on the Security Council has ended.
Finally, our education and cultural ties are reason for much celebration. This year marks the 30th
anniversary of our official program to facilitate academic exchanges and other bonds between us.
There are more than 5,000 Moroccan alumni of these. programs. Two are with us today â€” Dr.
Benjciloun and Dr. Ouaouicha â€” and we thank them. But among all our work on this front from
preserving Morocco's historic sites to empowering youth, there's one area I particularly hope we
can focus on today and receive your advice and counsel â€” munely, interfaith dialogue.
In these tense and turbulent times, its more important than ever for people of different faiths to
exchange ideas, to build understanding, to promote religious tolerance. It's one of the great
challenges of the 21 century, and it's one that we must address together.
So we have a lot of work to do, Minister, but our friendship runs long and deep, and as the treaty
our nations signed in 1786 says. and I quote, ""Trusting in God, it will remain permanent."" I'm
confident that we will continue to solve problems and produce results that make our nations
stronger more peaceful, more secure, more prosperous, and also contribute to doing the same Rif
the world.
So again, let me welcome you, Minister. Ifs been a great pleasure for me to get to know you, to
work with you, to be your colleague bilaterally, regionally, and globally, and also welcome your
distinguished delegation.
Thank you. (Applause.)
Remarks at Reception Marking Eid
September 13, 2012
SECRETARY CLINTON: Good evening, and although I am many weeks overdue in saying it:
Eid Mubarak. No matter how belated we are honoring Eid and the end of Ramadan, this is a
cherished tradition here at the State Department And I would like to thank all of you for being
here, including the many members of the Diplomatic Corps.

Tonight, our gathering is more somber than any of us would like. This comes during sad and
difficult days for the State Department family, We lost four Americans, They were good and
brave men, They were committed to the cause of building a brighter future for the people of
Libya. And we condemn the violence in the strongest terms, the violence against our posts in
Benghazi, in Egypt, and now in Yemen.
The Libyan ambassador is with us tonight, and I want to take a moment to thank him for the
support that his government and the Libyan people have shown to the United States in this
tragedy, particularly the outpouring of feelings of grief and loss because of the killing of our
ambassador.
Ambassador Aujali, would you mind saying a few words?
AMBASSADOR AUJALI: [redacted}
SECRETARY CLINTON: Thank you very much, Ambassador. I know that that was a very
personal loss for you, as it was for me. I'm the one who sent Chris to Benghazi during the
revolution to show support and be able to advise our government about what we could do to
bring freedom and democracy and opportunity to the people of Libya.
Religious freedom and religious tolerance are essential to the stability of any nation, any people.
Hatred and violence in the name of religion only poison the well. All people of faith and good
will know that the actions of a small and savage group in Benghazi do not honor religion or God
in any way. Nor do they speak for the more than one billion Muslims around the world, many of
whom have shown an outpouring of support during this time.
Unfortunately, however, over the last 24 hours, we have also seen violence spread elsewhere.
Some seek to justify this behavior as a response to inflammatory, despicable material posted on
the internet. As I said earlier today, the United States rejects both the content and the message of
that video. The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of
others. At our meeting earlier today, my colleague, the foreign minister of Morocco, said that all
prophets should be respected because they are all symbols of our humanity, for all humanity,
But both of us were crystal clear in this paramount message: There is never any justification for
violent acts of this kind. And we look to leaders around the world to stand up and speak out
against violence, and to take steps to protect diplomatic missions from attack.
Think about it. When Christians are subject to insults to their faith, and that certainly happens,
we expect them not to resort to violence. When Hindus or Buddhists are subjected to insults to
their faiths and that also certainly happens, we expect them not to resort to violence. The same
goes for all faiths, including Islam.

When all of us who are people of faith â€” and I am one â€” feel the pain of insults, of
misunderstanding, of denigration to what we cherish, we must expect ourselves and others not to
resort to violence. That is a universal standard and expectation, and it is everyone's obligation to
meet that, so that we make no differences, we expect no less of ourselves than we expect of
others. You cannot respond to offensive speech with violence without begetting more violence.
And I so strongly believe that the great religions of the world are stronger than any insults. They
have withstood offense for centuries. Refraining from violence, then, is not a sign of weakness in
one's faith; it is absolutely the opposite, a sign that one's faith is unshakable.
So tonight, we must come together and recommit ourselves to working toward a future marked
by understanding and acceptance rather than distrust, hatred, and fear. We can pledge that
whenever one person speaks out in ignorance and bigotry, ten voices will answer. They will
answer resoundingly against the offense and the insult, answering ignorance with enlightenment,
answering hatred with understanding, answering darkness with light; that if one person commits
a violent act in the name of religion, millions will stand up and condemn it out of strength.
In times like these, it can be easy to despair that some differences are irreconcilable, some
mountains too steep to climb; we will therefore never reach the level of understanding and
peacefulness that we seek, and which I believe the great religions of the world call us to pursue.
But that's not what I believe, and I don't think it's what you believe either here tonight. Part of
what makes our country so special is we keep trying. We keep working. We keep investing in
our future. We keep supporting the next generation, believing that young people can keep us
moving forward in a positive direction.
So tonight I think it's important that we talk not just about that better tomorrow that we all seek,
but also about some of the things â€” the real, practical, tangible things â€” that young people are
doing to help shape that better future.
Two years ago in this room, at our Eid reception, we launched a program called Generation
Change to lead a grassroots agenda of positive engagement with Muslim communities. And I
asked the young Muslim leaders in the audience that night to be our unofficial ambassadors, to
help build personal connections, seek out partners in other countries. And I can report to you
tonight they did not disappoint. In a few minutes, you're going to meet some of these young
leaders, each with a powerful story to tell.
The Generation Change network that started in this room now circles the globe. We are building
an international alliance of young people who want to drive change in their own communities.
They act as mentors, spark respectful debates, simply offer words of encouragement when
needed. But most importantly, they inspire others to keep expanding the circle of mutual
understanding and respect, one person at a time.

Even as we work to spread tolerance more broadly, we also are working to deepen our
appreciation for the experiences of others. Our 2012 Hours Against Hate initiative encourages
young people to put themselves in another person's shoes through service projects. So far, young
people from all over the world have pledged thousands of volunteer hours to help people from a
different background, to see them as a fellow human being, not a stereotype, not a caricature, but
another real live person â€” people who don't look like you, live like you, pray like you, but with
whom we will share this planet. And therefore, we have work to do.
People of faith and conscience are called to be the leaders of tolerance. In my tradition, like all
traditions, we are expected to love one another. And together, we have to translate that into better
understanding and cooperation. I'm particularly pleased that the young people you will hear from
tonight are really setting an example, not only for young people elsewhere in the world but,
frankly, for us who are older as well.
Let me now call to the stage someone who has been a tremendous assistance to me in these
efforts. Farah Pandith is the Department's first Special Representative to Muslim Communities.
And from the beginning, she has made reaching out to young people and civil society her top
priority. Farah will introduce you to three young leaders who I am very proud of.
Remarks at the Transfer of Remains Ceremony to Honor Those Lost in Attacks in Benghazi, Libya
September 14, 2012
SECRETARY CLINTON: Thank you very much, Chaplain. Mr. President, Mr. Vice President,
Secretary Panetta, Ambassador Rice, Secretary Powell and Mrs. Powell, family members of the
four patriots and heroes we bring home, members of the State Department family, ladies and
gentlemen, today we bring home four Americans who gave their lives for our country and our
values. To the families of our fallen colleagues, I offer our most heartfelt condolences and
deepest gratitude.
Sean Smith joined the State Department after six years in the Air Force. He was respected as an
expert on technology by colleagues in Pretoria, Baghdad, Montreal, and The Hague. He enrolled
in correspondence courses at Penn State and had high hopes for the future. Sean leaves behind a
loving wife Heather, two young children, Samantha and Nathan, and scores of grieving family,
friends, and colleagues. And that's just in this world. Because online in the virtual worlds that
Sean helped create, he is also being mourned by countless competitors, collaborators, and garners
who shared his passion.
Tyrone Woods, known to most as Rone, spent two decades as a Navy SEAL, serving multiple
tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. Since 2010, he protected American diplomatic personnel in
dangerous posts from Central America to the Middle East. He had the hands of a healer as well
as the arms of a warrior, earning distinction as a registered nurse and certified paramedic. Our
hearts go out to Tyrone's wife Dorothy, and his three sons Tyrone, Jr., Hunter, and Kai, born just
a few months ago, along with his grieving family, friends, and colleagues.

Glen Doherty, who went by Bub, was also a former SEAL and an experienced paramedic. He too
died as he lived, serving his country and protecting his colleagues. Glen deployed to some of the
most dangerous places on Earth, including Iraq and Afghanistan, always putting his life on the
line to safeguard other Americans. Our thoughts and prayers are with Glen's father Bernard, his
mother Barbara, his brother Gregory, his sister Kathleen, and their grieving families, friends, and
colleagues.
I was honored to know Ambassador Chris Stevens. I want to thank his parents and siblings, who
are here today, for sharing Chris with us and with our country. What a wonderful gift you gave
us. Over his distinguished career in the Foreign Service, Chris won friends for the United States
in far-flung places. He made those people's hopes his own. During the revolution in Libya, he
risked his life to help protect the Libyan people from a tyrant, and he gave his life helping them
build a better cowl
People loved to work with Chris. And as he rose through the ranks, they loved to work for Chris.
He was known not only for his courage but for his smile â€” goofy but contagious â€” for his sense
of fun and that California cool.
In the days since the attack, so many Libyans â€” including the Ambassador from Libya to the
United States, who is with us today â€” have expressed their sorrow and solidarity. One young
woman, her head covered and her eyes haunted with sadness, held up a handwritten sign that said
""Thugs and killers don't represent Benghazi nor Islam."" The President of the Palestinian
Authority, who worked closely with Chris when he served in Jerusalem, sent me a letter
remembering his energy and integrity, and deploring â€” and I quote â€” ""an act of ugly terror.""
Many others from across the Middle East and North Africa have offered similar sentiments.
This has been a difficult week for the State Department and for our country. We've seen the
heavy assault on our post in Benghazi that took the lives of those brave men. We've seen rage
and violence directed at American embassies over an awful internet video that we had nothing to
do with. It is hard for the American people to make sense of that because. it is senseless, and it is
totally unacceptable.
The people of Egypt, Libya, Yemen, and Tunisia did not trade the tyranny of a dictator for the
tyranny of a mob. Reasonable people and responsible leaders in these countries need to do
everything they can to restore security and hold accountable those behind these violent acts. And
we will, under the President's leadership, keep taking steps to protect our personnel around the
world.
There will be more difficult days ahead, but it is important that we don't lose sight of the
fundamental fact-that America must keep leading the world. We owe it to those four men to
continue the long, hard work of diplomacy. I am enormously proud of the men and women of the
State Department. I'm proud of all those across our government, civilian and military alike, who

represent America abroad, They help make the United States the greatest force for peace,
progress, and human dignity the world has ever known. If the last few days teach us anything, let
it be this: That this work and the men and women who risk their lives to do it are at the heart of
what makes America great and good.
So we will wipe away our tears, stiffen our spines, and face the future undaunted. And we will
do it together, protecting and helping one another, just like Sean, Tyrone, Glen, and Chris always
did. May God bless them and grant their families peace and solace, and may God continue to
bless the United States of America.
And now, let me have the great honor of introducing someone who came to the State Department
earlier this week to grieve with us. He well understands and values the work that these men were
doing for our country. The President of the United States.
Remarks With Mexican Secretary of Foreign Relations Patricia Espinosa After Their
Meeting
September 18, 2012
SECRETARY CLINTON: Good afternoon, everyone. And it is such a pleasure for me to
welcome my friend and colleague, Secretary Espinosa, along with a very distinguished
delegation of officials from the Mexican Government for this continuation of consultation at the
highest levels of each of our governments.
Before I turn to the matters discussed today, let me give a brief update on the ongoing U.S.
response to the protests in the Middle East and elsewhere. I'm sure as you know already, we are
taking aggressive steps to protect our staffs in embassies and consulates worldwide. That
includes reviewing our security posture at every post and augmenting it where necessary. And
we are working closely with the Libyan Government in our efforts to bring to justice those who
murdered our four American colleagues in Benghazi.
The FBI is now in Tripoli to join the investigation with Libyan officials, and there is nothing
more important to us than ensuring the safety of our American representatives worldwide. At the
same time, as I have said to State Department employees, the incidents of the past week highlight
how important our work is. The United States must and will remain strongly engaged in the
world. Our men and women risk their lives in service to our country and our values, because they
know that the United States must be a force for peace and progress. That is worth striving and
sacrificing for, and nothing that happened last week changes this fundamental fact.
Now, turning to our friends and partners in Mexico, we are always pleased to have a chance to
discuss matters of mutual interest and concern between us. Mexico is one of our closest friends
as well as partner on dozens of critical issues. So we talk about every kind of issue you can
imagine, from education and healthcare to poverty alleviation to the environment. But today, we
focused on a top priority for us both â€” security.

We just co-chaired the fourth meeting of the U.S.-Mexico Merida High-Level Consultative
Group. This is the last one we will hold during the Calderon Administration. And I want to offer
my personal appreciation to President Calderon and to Foreign Secretary Espinosa for their
leadership and commitment to this partnership and to all on both sides of the border in our
governments who have been deeply engaged and committed to it. The Merida Initiative
represents an unprecedented level of security cooperation between Mexico and the United States.
As our countries continue to deal with the serious challenge of transnational' criminal
organizations, including drug traffickers, illegal arms traffickers, money launderers, and violent
gangs that threaten people on both sides of the border, we well know there is no quick and easy
way to stop these criminals and bring them to justice. But nevertheless, during the past now
nearly four years, our countries have collaborated to an extraordinary and unprecedented degree.
We have brought together policy makers and experts from across our governments and societies
who have worked hand in hand to keep our people safe. And I think the habits of cooperation we
have built are among our most important achievements, and we will rely on them for a long time
to come.
Today, our delegations reviewed the gains we've made on key priorities, including improving
law enforcement coordination, reducing the demand for drugs, modernizing our border
infrastructure, strengthening the rule of law, and building more resilient and empowered
communities. We also discussed the lessons we've learned and the work that lies ahead in these
and other areas. which our joint statement will reflect. I want to underscore how important our
security relationship with Mexico is to the United States.
The Government of Mexico and the Mexican people have faced the threat posed by these
criminals with courage and resolve, and we remain committed to doing everything we can to
support Mexico as it continues to work to bring those criminals to justice. This is a transnational
problem, and it calls for a transnational solution, and the United States believes this is a matter of
shared responsibility. That was the first message I brought as Secretary of State when I came to
Mexico, and it continues to be the hallmark of our efforts together. Making sure our people are
safe and our neighbors are safe is of the utmost importance to us.
Now, our two countries share many other priorities, and one of them, empowering women and
girls, was also addressed today. We took the opportunity, the Foreign Secretary and I, to sign a
Memorandum of Understanding between our countries to work together to advance gender
equality, empower girls and women, promote their human rights, and enhance their security.
So again, Secretary Espinosa, let me thank you for years of work and effort, for our productive
conversations in many places around the world and again today, and for being such a valuable
colleague and partner. The United States deeply, deeply values our relationship with Mexico and
the ties of family and friendship that connect so many millions of our people.

And we look forward to the future. We believe strongly that presidential administrations may
change, elections will come and go, but we have established a firm foundation for cooperation
that has already benefited both our countries and which will continue to benefit both of our
countries for many years ahead. So thank you very much.
MS. NULAND: We'll take (inaudible), Margaret Brennan, CBS News.
QUESTION: Madam Secretary, thanks for your time. Are you any closer to finding who killed
Ambassador Chris Stevens?libya's President says this attack was planned for months. Are you
confident he's wrong and that security measures were appropriate? And will you leave justice to
the Libyans?
SECRETARY CLINTON: As I said at the outset, we are taking aggressive steps to protect our
people and our consulates and embassies around the world. We are reviewing our security
posture at every post and working with host govenunents to be sure they know what our security
needs are wherever necessary. We are also working closely with the Libyan Government to bring
the perpetrators to justice so that we can be assured that we have found who murdered our four
colleagues and under what circumstances. As I said, the FBI has joined the investigation inside
Libya, and we will not rest until the people who orchestrated this attack are found and punished.
It is also important to look at this strategically and understand what is going on across the region.
In a number of places where protests have turned violent, we are seeing the hand of extremists
who are trying to exploit people's inflamed passions for their own agendas. But overwhelmingly,
we have found that the people of Egypt, of Libya, of Yemen and Tunisia are not prepared to
trade the tyranny of a dictator for the tyranny of a mob. They want to turn their attention to the
future to provide better opportunities for themselves and their children, and they want a strong
partnership with the United States and the American people based on mutual interests and mutual
respect.
This is part of a larger debate that is going on inside these societies. In Libya, for example, in
their first free elections, moderates were successful at the polls. But look, there are extremists in
all of these societies and on the outside who are working to take advantage of broad outrage in
order to incite violence and specifically incite violence against Americans and American
facilities.
And as I have said to many of the leaders I have spoken to over the past week, these extremist
efforts are a threat to the people of the societies and the governments of those societies as well as
to the region and the United States. And I think it's important at this moment for leaders to put
themselves on the right side of this debate â€” to speak out clearly and unequivocally against
violence, whoever incites it or conducts it.
And in a struggle like this, there can he no doubt where the United States must stand. We support
those who are fighting for the same values and rights that we believe in â€” in democracy, in

freedom, in universal rights for men and women, for justice and accountability, And I want to
underscore that the United States will continue to work with partners and allies in the region and
around the world to help bring security to these nations so that the promise of the revolutions that
they experienced can be realized.
And finally, on your specific point about Benghazi, we obviously never talk publicly about
security at any of our missions for obvious reasons. But that said, let me assure you that our
security in Benghazi included a unit of host government security forces, as well as a local guard
force of the kind that we rely on in many places around the world. In addition to the security
outside the compound, we relied on a wall and a robust security presence inside the compound.
And with all of our missions overseas, in advance of September 11th, as is done every year we
did an evaluation on threat streams. And the Office of the Director of National Intelligence has
said we had no actionable intelligence that an attack on our post in Benghazi was planned or
imminent.
But let me state the obvious again. Our diplomats engage in dangerous work, and it's the nature
of diplomacy in fragile societies and conflict zones to be aware of the necessity for security but
to also continue the important diplomatic work that has to go on. There is risk inherent in what
we do and what these brave men and women representing the United States are up against every
single day, and we do our very best to limit that risk by ensuring that our security protocols
reflect the environments in which diplomats work and the threats that they are presented with.
Thank you.
Remarks With Indonesian Foreign Minister Raderi Mohammad Marty Miliaria
Natalegawa After Their Meeting
September 20, 2012
SECRETARY CLINTON: Good afternoon. everyone. And it's such a pleasure, as always, to
welcome the Indonesian Foreign Minister, and I believe the largest delegation that has ever come
from Indonesia, for the purpose of our third meeting of the U.S.-Indonesia Joint Commission.
This commission is the result of a vision by our two presidents for a comprehensive partnership,
and the agreement to that effect was signed in 2010. Thanks to this partnership, the United States
and Indonesia are working more closely than ever on a range of issues from global security to
clean energy and climate to regional trade and commerce.
And today, Marty and I had the chance to take stock of where our teams have come in the time
of the last year, because we had our meeting in Bali a year ago. And I must say, I was very
impressed. We covered a great deal today,

But before I start, I'd like to say a few words about the protests in several countries around the
world. We have condemned in the strongest possible terms the violence that has erupted from
these protests. And as I have said, the video that sparked these protests is disgusting and
reprehensible, and the United States Government, of course, had absolutely nothing to do with it.
But there is no justification for violence, and I want to thank the Foreign Minister and his
government for speaking out against violence. We have to look to reasonable people and
responsible leaders everywhere to stand up to extremists who would seek to take advantage of
this moment to commit violent acts against embassies and their fellow countrymen.
Today's meetings have highlighted the strong foundation that we have built together. And one of
our most important concerns is promoting peace and stability in the Asia Pacific. Today, I'm
announcing that the Obama Administration has informed Congress of the potential sale of eight
AH-64D Apache Longbow helicopters to the Indonesian Government. This agreement will
strengthen our comprehensive partnership and help enhance security across the region.
On growth and prosperity, we are increasing our trade relationship that topped $26 billion last
year. Investments in transportation, energy, and infrastructure are creating jobs and supporting
economic growth in both countries. For example, the deal between Lion Air and Boeing alone
represents $21 billion in trade over the next decade. Indonesia's Government has announced half
a trillion dollars in infrastructure improvements, and we recently signed a memorandum of
understanding to make it easier for American companies to bid on these projects.
And yesterday, we signed an agreement for implementing our Millennium Challenge
Corporation Compact with Indonesia. Over the next five years, the United States will invest $600
million in clean energy development, child health and nutrition programs, and efforts to help
make Indonesia's Government more transparent and open.
The United States is also looking forward to Indonesia hosting APEC in 2013, and we are
confident that Indonesia will come to this role with a commitment to promote greater economic
integration across the Asia Pacific.
Both the Foreign Minister and I believe that strong education is essential to compete in a modem
global economy. That's why the United States has expanded the Fulbright Program and
supported partnerships between dozens of American and Indonesian universities. Academic
exchanges between our countries are up and applications from Indonesian students to visit the
United States have increased by one third. USAID has recently expanded its basic education
program to provide $83 million for teacher training and literacy programs for young children.
And we're providing $20 in scholarship funding for Indonesian graduate students.

I also thanked the Minister for Indonesia's leadership in ASEAN. The Foreign Minister's
personal leadership has helped lay the groundwork for diplomacy between ASEAN and China as
it relates to the South China Sea. And we continue to support ASEAN's six-point principles,
which we believe will help reduce tensions and pave the way for a comprehensive code of
conduct for addressing disputes without threats, coercion, or use of force.
Finally, Indonesia and the United States have stood together on a range of global challenges,
from democratic reform in Burma to combating climate change, to working to end the violence
in Syria. We are also coordinating efforts to further develop south-south and triangular
cooperation, such as enhancing disaster preparedness in Burma and convening a conference on
women's empowerment.
We believe that as the second and third-largest democracies in the world, the United States and
Indonesia have a special responsibility to promote democracy and human rights. And for the last
four years, Indonesia has hosted the Bali Democracy Forum to promote peaceful, democratic
transitions through example and open dialogue. Last year, more than 80 countries attended. And
once again, the United States will be sending a high-level delegation.
So, Minister, thank you for everything. Thank you for the great partnership we've had between
us and between our countries.
MS. NULAND: We'll take two questions today,we'll start with Ros Jordan of Al Jazeera
English.
QUESTION: Thank you, Madam Secretary, Mr. Foreign Minister. Madam Secretary, my
question is about the ongoing investigation into last week's attack at the consulate in Benghazi.
You are meeting this afternoon with members of Congress to discuss the progress and the
concerns that they understandably have. First, there is the federal mandate to establish an
accountability review board. Have you done so? Who would you like to see chair it? Are there
certain questions that you desperately want to have answered in order to safeguard the safety of
Foreign Service Officers around the world?
And related to this, given the political instability and the successes of the past year and a half, are
you satisfied that in light of those political changes, enough was done to protect those working in
the Middle East and North Africa? And then finally â€” and this is perhaps going into the area of
rumor and speculation â€” but there is at least one report suggesting that Ambassador Stevens felt
that he was on a, quote, ""al-Qaida hit list."" Is this a scurrilous rumor? Is this gallows humor
when one is working in a period of difficulty and great challenge, or is there something more to
what he allegedly â€” and I stress that word â€” said?

SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, first, let me say I'm looking forward to the opportunity to go
up to the Congress today. I will be briefing in two separate sessions, the House and the Senate, in
a classified setting, along with my interagency colleagues, as we continue to work together, and
with governments around the world, to ensure that our people and our facilities are safe. I will be
joined today by the Director of National Intelligence, General Clapper, by the Deputy Secretary
of Defense, Ash Carter, by the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Sandy Witmefeld,
along with experts from the FBI, the State Department, and elsewhere in the government.
Now, I anticipate that this briefing will cover our security posture before and during the events,
and the steps we have taken since to do everything we can with host governments to protect our
people and our embassies and consulates. The Director of National Intelligence will speak to the
intelligence issues surrounding these events in Libya. Deputy Secretary Carter will brief on the
superb support we have had from the U.S. military in the wake of these events, and we are at the
very early stages of an FBI investigation. The team from the FBI reached Libya earlier this week.
And I will advise Congress also that I am launching an accountability review board that will be
chaired by Ambassador Thomas Pickering.
I will also talk about the importance of the broader relationships with these countries in light of
the events of the past days. There are obviously very real challenges in these new democracies,
these fragile societies, but as I said last week, the vast majority of the people in these countries
did not throw off the tyranny of a dictator to trade it for the tyranny of a mob. And we are
concerned first and foremost with our own people and facilities, but we are concerned about the
internal security in these countries because ultimately, that puts at risk the men, women, and
children of these societies on a daily ongoing basis if actions are not taken to try to restore
security and civil order.
And let me just conclude by saying that there can be no doubt where the United States stands.
We continue to support those who are fighting for universal values â€” values that we see at work
in Indonesia â€” the third largest democracy in the world. We believe that these values of universal
rights, of justice and accountability, of democracy, are there for every person regardless of where
that person might live. So I will look forward to having a chance to talk with members of
Congress.
As to your final question, I have absolutely no information or reason to believe that there's any
basis for that.
QUESTION: Thank you.
MS. NULAND: Last question. Victoria Sidjabat from Tempo Magazine, please.

designed as a weapon to attack U.S. by raising sentiment anti-U.S. from the countries which has
Muslim majority population like Indonesia.
Madam Clinton, how do you see this threat as on the long run? If it's continuing happen, it's
obviously could give impact to the implementation of (inaudible) program in Indonesia. What is
the reason U.S. Government closed the Embassy and Consulate in Indonesia? What is your
expectation from Indonesia Government, for my Minister Marty Natalegawa? How Indonesia
Government respond to the closing of this Embassy and Consulate, it's starting today? Is U.S. -
Indonesia Government has Capability to protect U.S. Embassy and Consulate. So the (inaudible)
program implemented - could be implemented successfidly in Indonesia. Thank you
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, let me begin by saying how grateful we are for the excellent
cooperation we have received from the Government of Indonesia, and in particular, from the law
enforcement and security institutions in Indonesia. We are very grateful for not only the
cooperation and protection that has been provided to our facilities, but also to the strong
statements condemning violence from the President, the Foreign Minister, and others.
In consultation with the Government of Indonesia, we have temporarily, for tomorrow, closed
our facilities. We want to be sure that law enforcement in Indonesia has the ability to do what it
needs to do to make sure that there is no disruption of civil order and security. So we are
cooperating completely, and we're very grateful for the strong leadership provided by Indonesia.
FOREIGN MINIStER NATALEGAWA: Hello, (inaudible), if I may just also respond.
Precisely as the Secretary had said, the decision by the United States Government to close
temporarily its embassies and consulates tomorrow in Indonesia is a decision that's been made
based on communication and conversation between the authorities in Indonesia and the United
States as well. So in other words, it is an informed decision, a decision that is not intended to
show any unfriendly intent on the part of anyone, but it is what it is, and it's quite some - it's the
kind of step that governments actually carry out when situations requires it, even in our case.
Some of our embassies abroad, when the situation requires us to have a temporary closing of the
embassy, we do that as well. So it is something that is quite regular and something that is
actually coordinated as well.
But if I may just broaden the subject matter, I think as our President had said in the past,
Indonesian Government - the Indonesian people, even, obviously cannot and would not condone
the - any acts of violence against diplomatic premises, against diplomatic personnel, because
that is, truly - would be a challenge to the efficient and a proper conduct of relations among
states. So that's our point of departure.
At the same time, of course, beyond the immediate issue of protection of the embassies, we have
still ahead of us the challenge of how to prevent the kind of situations where we are now at in

terms of the kind of incendiary and the kind of statements or, in this instance, films that cause â€”
that is now we have all deplored and condemned for these kind of activities not to be repeated.
So we have a lot of homework to work towards in the future as well.

Remarks With Pakistani Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar Before Their Meeting
September 21, 2012
Good afternoon, and let me begin by welcoming Foreign Minister Khar on her first visit to
Washington as foreign minister. We've had the opportunity to meet in Islamabad and other
settings, but I am very pleased that we would have this chance to exchange views on our bilateral
relationship as well as regional and global issues.
I want to begin by addressing the events of the day and the past week. Today, we've once again
seen protests in several cities in Pakistan. Unfortunately, some of those protests have turned
violent and, sadly, resulted in loss of life. I want to thank the Government of Pakistan for their
efforts to protect our Embassy in Islamabad and consulates in Lahore, Peshawar, and Karachi.
And I want to be clear, as I have said on numerous occasions, the violence we have seen cannot
be tolerated. There is no justification for violence. Of course, there is provocation, and we have
certainly made clear that we do not in any way support provocation We found the video that's at
the core of this series of events offensive, disgusting, reprehensible.
But that does not provide justification for violence, and therefore it is important for responsible
leaders, indeed responsible people everywhere, to stand up and speak out against violence and
particularly against those who would exploit this difficult moment to advance their own
extremist ideologies.
Yesterday afternoon when I briefed the Congress, I made it clear that keeping our people
everywhere in the world safe is our top priority. What happened in Benghazi was a terrorist
attack, and we will not rest until we have tracked down and brought to justice the terrorists who
murdered four Americans. And we are taking aggressive measures at all of our posts to protect
our staffs and their families along with locally employed people who provide so many important
contributions to the work of our missions.
The Foreign Minister and I will have a chance to cover a full range of subjects today, and it is no
secret that the past year and a half has been challenging for Pakistan and the United States. And
we still have work to do to get our bilateral relationship to the point where we would like it to be,
but â€˜ve 1
,

today is the latest in a series of high-level meetings. Ambassador Marc Grossman has just
returned from consultations in Islamabad. I look forward to seeing President Zardari next week
at the UN General Assembly. At each meeting, we are working to identify the strategic goals we
share â€” and there are many â€” and the concrete actions we can each take to accomplish them.
Our number one shared priority remains pursuing our joint counterterrorism objectives to ensure
the security of American and Pakistani citizens alike. We face a common threat from a common
enemy, and we must confront terrorism and extremism together. Earlier this Month, I designated
the Haggani Network as a Foreign Terrorist Organization so we could make full use of every
available legal authority to end their deadly attacks. Pakistan's parliament has called for
expelling foreign fighters so that Pakistan's territory can be fully under control of the Pakistani
Government and cannot be used to launch attacks against other nations.
And the follow-through on this is challenging but necessary, and we look forward to working
with Pakistan as they continue to address these problems. We have both pledged to support a
secure, stable, and prosperous Afghanistan, which is vital for the security of the region. And I
want to thank Foreign Minister Khar for Pakistan's reopening of the NATO supply lines to allow
the movement of goods to Afghanistan.
We will discuss the successful first meeting of the Safe Passage Working Group in Islamabad
which brought together Afghan, Pakistani, and U.S. representatives to advance the peace process
in Afghanistan. The Pakistani Government's public call for insurgents to come forward and talk
with the Afghan Government was particularly important. We are ready to work together to build
on these steps, and we will continue OUT discussions through bilateral consultations and the U.S.-
Afghanistan-Pakistan Core Group.
Now, of course, our relationship goes far beyond our shared security concerns, and today we will
discuss the many other ways in which we work together, particularly to create economic
opportunity for Pakistanis. Foreign Minister Khar and I agree that we need to shift our economic
relationship front aid to trade and investment. We are working to help Pakistan attract more
private sector investment We hope to finalize a bilateral investment treaty soon. And we've
created a Pakistan private investment initiative to help more of Pakistan's small and medium
sized companies get access to capital.
Over the past few years, we have seen Pakistan's civilian government begin to put down stronger
roots. And if elections proceed as planned next year, it will mark the first time in Pakistan's
history that a civilian-led government has served its full term. The United States supports
Pakistan's economic development, and we have said many times that we want to see democracy
succeed in Pakistan.

We also support Pakistan's sovereignty, but we are clear that all sovereign nations carry certain
obligations to protect the human rights of their citizens, to control their territory, to prevent
threats to their neighbors and the international community.
So we know that there is still much to be done, but I can assure the people of Pakistan that the
United States remains committed to this important relationship and we are confident we can
continue to move forward together one step at a time to reach our shared strategic objectives.
Thank you very much.
Remarks With Tunisian Foreign Minister Rafik Ahdessalem Before Their Meeting
September 21, 2012
SECRETARY CLINTON: Good morning. I am pleased to welcome the Foreign Minister from
Tunisia. I'm looking forward to our meeting. We obviously have a great deal to discuss, and I
want to thank the Foreign Minister and the Government of Tunisia for their efforts over the last
week to help secure our Embassy and the American Cooperative School of Tunis following the
violent assaults of last Friday.
We are monitoring events closely today. There is no higher priority for President ()barna and
myself than the safety of our people. We've taken a number of steps around the world to
augment security and to protect our personnel at diplomatic posts. And we are working closely
with host governments in this effort.
As I have said before and as is embodied in the Vienna Convention and other international
agreements, all governments have the duty, the solemn duty, to defend diplomatic missions.
They must be safe and protected places so that governments can exchange views and work on
many important issues, and leaders across the world must stand up and be counted in rejecting
violence and holding violent actors accountable.
We are working closely with the Government of Tunisia. They have assisted us in enhancing the
security of our facilities. We've also discussed with them the imperative of bringing to justice
those responsible for these violent attacks. And we have offered and will continue to look for
ways that we can assist the new Government of Tunisia in ensuring the rule of law throughout
their country, first and foremost for the people of Tunisia themselves. We look forward to
continuing to build our new partnership with the Tunisian Government and people. Our
relationship is built around the shared principles of all democracies â€” a commitment to
nonviolence, to tolerance, and inelusivity for all people, and to upholding the rule of law.
The Tunisian people have bravely put themselves on the road to democracy. They were the first
of the Arab revolutions and they have made important progress in a very short period of time.
They have worked too hard and sacrificed too much over too many years to see their progress
hijacked or derailed by extremists with their own agenda. And those extremists, not only in

Tunisia but in too many places around the world, look for opportunities to exploit this current
situation or other situations, and all people and leaders must stand against them.
So as the Tunisian Government takes steps to strengthen security and protect the Tunisian people
and economy from extremism and violent agendas, the United States stands ready to help. We
also are working closely with Tunisia on the broader shared threat of terrorism, including from
groups like al-Qaida and its affiliates.
So Minister, please know the United States remains committed to supporting Tunisia as you deal
with this current situation, as you continue your democratic transition, and we want to be with
you as you confront challenges and help seize opportunities together for the betterment of the
future of Tunisia.

OP-ED CONTRIBUTOR
In Libya and Elsewhere, Our Diplomats Deserve Better
By PRUDENCE BUSHNELL
Published: September 14, 2012
Falls Church, Va.
THERE is a black wall in a State Department lobby inscribed with the names of those who died while serving overseas.
Every time I passed that wall after Al Qaeda blew up two American Embassies in East Africa in 1998, I thought of the 12
American and 32 Kenyan friends and colleagues who died on my watch as ambassador. I thought of my own journey
that day down flights of stairs in the building next door to the embassy, after having been knocked out by the blast, of
the people who risked their lives to save others and of how we carried on under horrendous circumstances
Now every time I pass the black marble wall, I will think of Ambassador a Christopher Stevens and his colleagues who
died after an attack on our consulate in Benghazi, Libya, this week,
Diplomats don't often make headlines until something horrible happens. Even then, it is policy and politics that get the
attention. We had barely learned of the attack before talking heads began to expound on Middle East policies and the
words administration officials used or should have used, to uphold our national dignity. Where were the conversations
about the diplomats who were actually carrying out those policies in faraway, often dangerous places, the people who
take care of us despite the hardship and risk? Imagine what it must have been like trying to escape the raging fire in the
Benghazi consulate or enduring hours of assault in the nearby annex waiting for relief from the Libyan government.
Diplomacy is a dangerous profession. You cannot exert influence by whispering in diplomatic code to your government
counterparts behind closed doors. You do not spread American values - especially in places where passions are high,
governments fragile and guns plentiful - by remote control from Washington. You have to get out from behind the walls
and engage with people. We know this can put us in harm's way; our people in the Benghazi consulate knew it. And they
did their jobs anyway.
That is because, hokey as it sounds, the people who represent us overseas really do believe they can make a difference.
They confront violent behavior and strong passions with American leadership, smart power and peaceful means.
We must make that work safer. The reasons for violence change with time and place but the human effects are the
same. For two years before we were blown up in Nairobi, Kenya, my team and I fought (""nagged"" was the word State
Department colleagues used) to have security threats and vulnerabilities addressed. We were too close to the street, an
easy target. Washington's assessment was that things were 0.1e, Anyway, I was told, there was no money for a more
secure embassy. What was Washington's assessment of our consulate in Benghazi? We may not like the image of
American diplomats working out of fortified boxes, but we cannot let them work in buildings that can be overrun by
attackers. This is a lesson our government still hasn't learned since 1979 in Tehran,
If the Benghazi tragedy traces the same journey we made from the rubble in Nairobi, heartfelt pronouncements will be
made; the dead will be given due homage and then they will be buried. The press will alight on other stories. A
Congressionally mandated accountability review board will determine what happened and what needs to be done to

avoid such tragedies in the future. Easy fixes changes to emergency action plans, minor security upgrades - will be
made; expensive and hard ones will not.
The Foreign Service is short on people, and those people are rushed into the field short on training. We build concrete
fortresses when we have to, but we don't invest in the mobile communications and security technology that would
protect diplomats when they leave the embassy, as they must. What kinds of technology, systems, training and
deployment do we need to get results through diplomacy in the 21st century? These are the difficult questions that will
remain unanswered, while diplomats disappear from public view once again. Until the next time someone dies - then we
see the same sorry response all over again.
But we can give meaning to this tragedy. What if President Obama and Mitt Romney exercised true leadership by
explaining to Americans, including the families and friends of those who died in Benghazi, what diplomacy is all about?
Why using words and deeds for peace is as important as using weapons. Why we value our diplomats and what we will
do to make their jobs easier, if we cannot guarantee their absolute security.
It is a stretch, I know. Far easier to add some more concrete, declare our responsibilities to diplomats complete and
move back to the fun stuff of making and debating policy, most of it domestic. The black wall will continue to
accumulate names, diplomats will continue to represent our country on the cheap and nothing much will change. Like
that scenario? If not, start demanding leadership. That is what Chris Stevens and his team were providing. Let's think
about them and reciprocate.

GOP's October surprise?
They're calling it the ""Jimmy Carter Strategy"": Exploit
Libya attack to paint Obama as weak on terrorism
By cY'aia?,_
(Credit: AP/AI Behrman/Salort)
According to a highly reliable source, as Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama prepare for the
first presidential debate Wednesday night, top Republican operatives are primed to unleash a new
two-pronged offensive that will attack Obama as weak on national security, and will be based, in part,
on inW !ia:en,y-.3iTeForrnation regarding the attacks in Libya that killed U.S. ambassador Chris
Stevens on September
The source, who has first-hand knowledge of private, high-level conversations in the Romney tamp
that took place in Washington, DC last week, said that at various times the GOP strategists referred to
their new operation as the Jimmy Carter Strategy or the October Surprise.
He added that they planned to release what they hoped would be ""a bombshell"" that would make
Libya and Obama's foreign policy a major issue in the campaign. ""My understanding is that they have
come up with evidence that the Obama administration had positive intelligence that there was going
to be a terrorist attack on the intelligence.""
The source described the Republicans as chortling with glee that the Obama administration
""definitely had intel"" about the attack before it happened. ""Intelligence can be graded in different
ways,"" he added, ""and sometimes A and B don't get connected. But [the Romney campaign] will try to
paint it to look like Obama had advance knowledge of the attack and is weak on terrorism.""
He said they were jubilant about their new strategy and said they intended to portray Obama as a
helpless, Jimmy Carter-like president and to equate the tragedy in Libya with President Carter's failed
attempt to rescue American hostages in Iran in t980. ""They are so excited about it,"" he said. ""Over
and over again they talked about bow it would be just like Jimmy Carter's failed raid. They feel it is
going to give them .a last-minute landslide in the election.""
The source, however, said lie was dubious about the tactic. ""To me, it is indicative that they have lost
touch with a huge portion of the electorate,"" he said.
The source declined to reveal the names of the GOP operatives who were present. But he said, ""These
were the top guys in the party. It was a .private, unguarded planning conversation."" He further

described participants in the meeting as consisting of well-known names tied to the big Republican
super PACs and people who had access to high-level national security intelligence.
""As usual, Karl Rove wasn't present,"" he said, ""but some were close to Rove.""
The source said that ""there was quite a bit more"" to the operation than simply revealing the
intelligence regarding Libya. He declined to discuss what he described as the second phase of the
operation.
However, already there is evidence that the first phase of the operation is underway. On Wednesday,
September 26, on Fox News, Karl Rove called Obama's reaction to what happened in Libya
""inexplicable"" and added that Obama is ""more intent on campaigning than meeting his
responsibilities as commander-in-chief."" He went on to warn that Obama's policies in Libya
endangered the U.S. with regard to Iran. ""I am astonished,"" Rove said. ""We are projecting weakness
when we need to be projecting strength.""
Similarly, former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a one-time GOP presidential hopeful who
became known as the mayor of 9/11, followed Rove in criticizing Obama on the attack in Libya. ""This
is a deliberate attempt to cover up the truth, from an administration that claimed it wanted to be the
most transparent in history,"" he told Fox News. ""And it's the worst kind of cover-up: the kind of
cover-up that involves our national security. This is a cover-up that involves the slaughter of four
Americans.""
Giuliani added that the Obama White House wanted to dismiss the role played by al-Qaeda because it
seemed to diminish the triumph of having killed Osama bin Laden. ""I think it's because they have this
narrative that they defeated al-Qaeda,"" he said. ""They never say the words 'Islamic fundamentalist
terrorism'. They want to wish it away. The president was moving on to Asia â€” he was going to declare
this a great victory for himself and unfortunately, this terrible act of terror intervened in their very
convenient narrative.""
Likewise, Bob Corker, Republican senator from Tennessee, described the administration's response to
""the terrorist attack"" in Libya as And on Sunday, September 30, both Mitt Romney and
vice-presidential nominee Paul Ryan joined in the attacks. ""I think they want to do their very best to
keep the people of America from understanding exactly what happened. We expect candor, we expect
transparency, particularly as it relates to terrorism,"" Romney said.
Added Ryan, ""Why is he (Obama) not on the same page with his own administration officials who are
saying that this is a terrorist attack? We'll leave it up to you to decide whether it's a cover-up or not.""
In an apparently related development, a Politico artkle posted last night said Romney advisers were
divided over hovv aggressively to attack President Obama over his handling of the events in Libya. One
unnamed Romney adviser described them as ""a huge gift"" to the campaign. ""Across the board â€”
domestic, economic and foreign-policy issues â€” President Obama has been outmatched by events,"" he
said. ""He's an observer of events, not a shaper of events. Everywhere you look, he's been outmatched.""
But other Romney advisers, led by media strategist Stuart Stevens, wanted to stick to the economy as
the central issue. ""They'll tell you that you've got to focus people on the fact that their economic
prospects are not very good and all that,"" the aide told Politico. ""Well, Romney's been trying to do that
now since he clinched the nomination at the end of April â€” and he's failed. The president is better at
deflecting attention from the bad news than Romney is at driving home the impact of the bad news on
individual voters.""

According to Politico yesterday, there was an internal argument within the Romney campaign over
Libya. Obviously, the neocons and the Rove oriented faction (Ed Gillespie, Rove's surrogate is now a
Romney campaign adviser) beat Stuart Stevens.
Romney is careening from tactic to tactic, hoping something will catch.
I wouldn't be surprised to see Romney raise the specter of the Muslim Brotherhood in charge of Egypt
& Libya as a bogeyman. I have heard him do this within the last week.

is a deliberate attempt to cover up the truth, from an administration that claimed it wanted to be the
most transparent in history,"" he told Fox News. ""And it's the worst kind of cover-up: the kind of
cover-up that involves our national security. This is a cover-up that involves the slaughter of four
Americans.""
Giuliani added that the Obama White House wanted to dismiss the role played by al-Qaeda because it
seemed to diminish the triumph of having killed Osama bin Laden. ""I think it's because they have this
narrative that they defeated al-Qaeda,"" he said. ""They never say the words 'Islamic fundamentalist
terrorism'. They want to wish it away. The president was moving on to Asia â€” he was going to declare
this a great victory for himself and unfortunately, this terrible act of terror intervened in their very
convenient narrative.""
Likewise, Bob Corker, Republican senator from Tennessee, described the administration's response to
""the terrorist attack"" in Libya as laiaarre."" And on Sunday, September 30, both Mitt Romney and
vice-presidential nominee Paul Ryan joined in the attacks. ""I think they want to do their very best to
keep the people of America from understanding exactly what happened. We expect candor, we expect
transparency, particularly as it relates to terrorism,"" Romney said.
Added Ryan, ""Why is he (Obama) not on the same page with his own administration officials who are
saying that this is a terrorist attack? We'll leave it up to you to decide whether it's a cover-up or not.""
In an apparently related development, a Politico article posted last night said Romney advisers were
divided over how aggressively to attack President Obama over his handling of the events in Libya. One
unnamed Romney adviser described them as ""a huge gift"" to the campaign. ""Across the board â€”
domestic, economic and foreign-policy issues â€” President Obama has been outmatched by events,"" he
said. ""He's an observer of events, not a shaper of events. Everywhere you look, he's been outmatched.""
But other Romney advisers, led by media strategist Stuart Stevens, wanted to stick to the economy as
the central issue. ""They'll tell you that you've got to focus people on the fact that their economic
prospects are not very good and all that,"" the aide told Politico. ""Well, ROITIlley'S been trying to do that
now since he clinched the nomination at the end of April â€” and he's failed. The president is better at
deflecting attention from the bad news than Romney is at driving home the impact of the bad news on
individual voters.""

According to Politico yesterday, there was an internal argument within the Romney campaign over
Libya. Obviously, the neocons and the Rove oriented faction (Ed Gillespie, Rove's surrogate is now a
Romney campaign adviser) beat Stuart Stevens.
Romney is careening from tactic to tactic, hoping something will catch.
I wouldn't be surprised to see Romney raise the specter of the Muslim Brotherhood in charge of Egypt

GOP's October surprise?
They're calling it the ""Jimmy carter Strategy"": Exploit
Libya attack to paint Obama as weak on terrorism
By Craig Unger_g:
(Credit: AP/AlBehrman/Salon)
According to a highly reliable source, as Mitt Romney and President 13arack Obama prepare for the
first presidential debate Wednesday night, top Republican operatives are primed to unleash a new
two-pronged offensive that will attack Obama as weak on national security, and will be based, in part,
on new intelligence information regarding the attacks in Libya that killed U.S. ambassador Chris
Stevens on September
The source, who has first-hand knowledge of private, high-level conversations in the Romney camp
that took place in Washington, DC last week, said that at various times the GOP strategists referred to
their new operation as the Jimmy Carter Strategy or the October Surprise.
He added that they planned to release what they hoped would be ""a bombshell"" that would make
Libya and Obama's foreign policy a major issue in the campaign. ""My understanding is that they have

come up with evidence that the Mama administration had positive intelligence that there was going
to be a terrorist attack on the intelligence.""
The source described the Republicans as chortling with glee that the Obama administration
""definitely had inter"" about the attack before it happened. ""Intelligence can be graded in different
ways,"" he added, ""and sometimes A and B don't get connected. But [the Romney campaign] will try to
paint it to look like Mama had advance knowledge of the attack and is weak on terrorism?'
He said they were jubilant about their new strategy and said they intended to portray Obama as a
helpless, Jimmy Carter-like president and to equate the tragedy in Libya with President Carter's failed
attempt to rescue American hostages in Iran in 1980. ""They are so excited about it,"" he said. ""Over
and over again they talked about how it would be just like Jimmy Carter's failed raid. They feel it is
going to give them a last-minute landslide in the election.""
The source, however, said he was dubious about the tactic. ""To me, it is indicative that they have lost
touch with a huge portion of the electorate,"" he said.
The source declined to reveal the names of the GOP operatives who were present. But he said, ""These
were the top guys in the party. It was a private, unguarded planning conversation."" He further
described participants in the meeting as consisting of well-known names tied to the big Republican
super PACs and people who had access to high-level national security intelligence.
""As usual, Karl Rove wasn't present,"" he said, ""but some were close to Rove.""
The source said that ""there was quite a bit more"" to the operation than simply revealing the
intelligence regarding Libya. He declined to discuss what he described as the second phase of the
operation.
However, already there is evidence that the first phase of the operation is underway. On Wednesday,
September 26, on Fox News, Karl Rove called Obama's reaction to what happened in Libya
""inexplicable"" and added that Obama is ""more intent on campaigning than meeting his
responsibilities as commander-in-chief."" He went on to warn that Obama's policies in Libya
endangered the U.S. with regard to Iran. ""I am astonished,"" Rove said. ""We are projecting weakness
when we need to be projecting strength.""
Similarly, former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a one-time GOP presidential hopeful who
became known as the mayor of OA, followed Rove in criticizing Obama on the attack in Libya. ""This
is a deliberate attempt to cover up the truth, from an administration that claimed it wanted to be the
most transparent in history,"" he told Fox News. ""And it's the worst kind of cover-up: the kind of
cover-up that involves our national security. This is a cover-up that involves the slaughter of four

Likewise, Bob Corker, Republican senator from Tennessee, described the administration's response to
""the terrorist attack"" in Libya as ""bizarre."" And on Sunday, September 30, both Mitt Romney and
vice-presidential nominee Paul Ryan joined in the attacks. ""I think they want to do their very best to

said. ""He's an observer of events, not a shaper of events. Everywhere you look, he's been outmatched.""

Pretty uncompelling piece if you ask me, but of course I'm biased.
Mitt Romney: A New Course for the Middle East
Restore the three sinews of American influence: our economic strength, our military strength and the strength of our values.
Disturbing developments are sweeping across the greater Middle East. In Syria, tens of thousands of innocent people have been slaughtered. In Egypt, the Muslim
Brotherhood has come to power, and the country's peace treaty with Israel hangs In the balance. In Libya, our ambassador was murdered In a terrorist attack. U.S.
embassies throughout the region have been stormed in violent protests. And in Iran, the ayatollahs continue to move full tilt toward nuclear-weapons capability, all
the while promising to annihilate Israel.
These developments are not, as President Obama says, mere ""bumps in the road."" They are major issues that put our security at risk.
Yet amid this upheaval, our country seems to be at the mercy of events rather than shaping them. We're not moving them in a direction that protects our people or
our allies.
And that's dangerous. If the Middle East descends into chaos, if Iran moves toward nuclear breakout, or if Israel's security is compromised, America could be
pulled into the maelstrom.
We still have time to address these threats, but it will require a new strategy toward the Middle East
The first step is to understand how we got here. Since World War II, America has been the leader of the Free World. We're unique in having earned that role not
through conquest but through promoting human rights, free markets and the rule of law. We ally ourselves with like-minded countries, expand prosperity through
trade and keep the peace by maintaining a military second to none.
But in recent years, President Obama has allowed our leadership to atrophy. Our economy is stuck in a ""recovery"" that barely deserves the name. Our national
debt has risen to record levels. Our military, tested by a decade of war, is facing devastating cuts thanks to the budgetary games played by the White House.
Finally, our values have been misappliedâ€”and misunderstoodâ€”by a president who thinks that weakness will win favor with our adversaries.
By failing to maintain the elements of our influence and by stepping away from our allies, President Obama has heightened the prospect of conflict and instability.
He does not understand that an American policy that lacks resolve can provoke aggression and encourage disorder.
The Middle East is a case in point. The Arab Spring presented an opportunity to help move millions of people from oppression to freedom. But it also presented
grave risks. We needed a strategy for success, but the president offered none. And now he seeks to downplay the significance of the calamities of the past few
weeks
The same incomprehension afflicts the president's policy toward Israel. The president began his term with the explicit policy of creating ""daylight"" between our two
countries. He recently downgraded Israel from being our ""closest ally"" in the Middle East to being only ""one of our closest allies."" It's a diplomatic message that will
be received clearly by Israel and its adversaries alike. He dismissed Israel's concerns about Iran as mere ""noise"" that he prefers to ""block out."" And at a time when
Israel needs America to stand with it, he declined to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
In this period of uncertainty, we need to apply a coherent strategy of supporting our partners in the Middle Eastâ€”that is, both governments and individuals who
share our values.
This means restoring our credibility with Iran. When we say an Iranian nuclear-weapons capabilityâ€”and the regional instability that comes with it--is unacceptable,
the ayatollahs must be made to believe us.
It means placing no daylight between the United States and Israel, And it means using the full spectrum of our soft power to encourage liberty and opportunity for
those who have for too long known only corruption and oppression. The dignity of work and the ability to steer the course of their lives are the best alternatives to
extremism.
But this Middle East policy will be undermined unless we restore the three sinews of our influence: our economic strength, our military strength and the strength Of
our values. That will require a very different set of policies from those President Obama is pursuing.

The 20th century became an American Century because we were steadfast in defense of freedom. We made the painful sacrifices necessary to defeat
totalitarianism In all of Its guises.. To defend ourselves and our allies, we paid the price in treasure and in soldiers who never came home.
Our challenges are different now, but if the 21st century is to be another American Century, we need leaders who understand that keeping the peace requires
American strength in all of its dimensions.

attempt to rescue American hostages in Iran in 1980. ""They are so excited about it,"" he said. ""Over
and over again they talked about how it would be just like Jimmy Carter's failed raid. They feel it is
going to give, them a last-minute landslide in the election.""
The source, however, said he was dubious about the tactic. '""To me, it is indicative that they have lost
touch with a huge portion of the electorate,"" he said.
The source declined-to reveal the names of the GOP operatives who were present. But he said, ""These
were the top guys in the party. It was a private, unguarded planning conversation."" He further
described participants in the meeting as consisting of well-known names tied to the big Republican
super PACs and people who had access to high-level national security intelligence.
""As usual, Karl Rove wasn't present,"" he said, ""but some were close to Rove.'
The source said that ""there was quite a bit more"" to the operation than simply revealing the
intelligence regarding Libya. He declined to discuss what he described as the second phase of the
operation.
However, already there is evidence that the first phase of the operation is underway. On Wednesday,
September 26, on Fox News, Karl Rove called Obama's reaction to what happened in Libya
-leeetalieeble': and added that Obama is ""more intent on campaigning than meeting his
responsibilities as commander-in-chief."" He went on to warn that Obama's policies in Libya
endangered the U.S.. with regard to Iran. ""I am astonished,"" Rove said. ""We are projecting weakness.
when we need to be projecting strength.""
Similarly, former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a one-time COP presidential hopeful who
became. known as the mayor of 9/11, followed Rove in criticizing Obama on the attack in Libya. ""This
is a deliberate attempt to cover up the truth, from an administration that claimed it wanted to be the
most transparent in history,"" he told Fox News. ""And it's the worst kind of cover-up: the kind of
cover-up that involves our national security. This is a cover-up that involves the slaughter of four
Americans.""
Giuliani added that the Obama White House wanted to dismiss the role played by al-Qaeda because it
seemed to diminish the triumph of having killed Osama bin Laden. ""I think it's because they have this
narrative that they defeated al-Qaeda,"" he said. ""They never say the words 'Islamic fundamentalist
terrorism'. They want to wish it away. The president was moving on to Asia - he was going to declare
this a great victory for himself and unfortunately, this terrible act of terror intervened in their very
convenient narrative.""
Likewise, Bob Corker, Republican senator from Tennessee, described the administration's response tb
""the terrorist attack"" in Libya as z' And
And on Sunday, September 30, both Mitt Romney and
vice-presidential nominee Paul Ryan joined in the attacks. 'I think they want to do their very best to
keep the people of America from understanding exactly' what happened. We expect candor, we expect.

Added Ryan, ""Why is he (Obama) not on the same page with his own administration officials who are
saying that this is a terrorist attack? We'll leave it up to you to decide whether it's a cover-up or not.""
In an apparently related development, a Politico article posted last night said Romney advisers were
divided over how aggressively to attack President Obama over his handling of the events in Libya. One
unnamed Romney adviser described them as ""a huge gift"" to the campaign. ""Across the board â€”
domestic, economic and foreign-policy issues â€” President Obama has been outmatched by events,"" he
said. ""He's an observer of events, not a shaper of events. Everywhere you look, he's been outmatched.""
But other Romney advisers, led by media strategist Stuart Stevens, wanted to stick to the economy as
the central issue. ""They'll tell you that you've got to focus people on the fact that their economic
prospects are not very good and all that,"" the aide told Politico. ""Well, Romney's been trying to do that
now since he clinched the nomination at the end of April â€” and he's failed. The president is better at
deflecting attention from the bad news than Romney is at driving home the impact of the bad news on
individual voters.""

RE: gorgeous pie on the front page of the NWT!
Bic sending more arms into a society generally â€” particularly when they are as disorganized and fragmented as they are
â€” will result in more violence â€” against each other. Boys like to play with guns (trust me as the mother of sons). I am all
for saying we have no objection to French doing it to increase pressure on Gaddafi, but in a tribal society where conflicts
have been repressed for so long, adding even more weapons does not make sense. Obviously they can get weapons
from other places, but nb that they are not awash in weapons now. I wrote something for New York Review of Books
this week that builds on my farewell remarks and I think you will like it; will send it to you for weekend reading,","UNCLASSIFIED

Re: Morsi's private conversations & coordination with Magariaf
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the
highest levels of European governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
I. Late in the day on September 14, 2012, Egyptian President Mohamad Morsi told senior
European diplomats that he is increasingly concerned the current anti-U.S. and anti-Western violence
spreading through Cairo and into the rest of Egypt may be part of an effort by his Salafist political
rivals to destabilize his government, which many of them believe is too moderate in its positions
regarding Islam, Israel, and the non-Muslim world. According to this source, Morsi, who is in
Brussels for meetings with the European Union (EU), was particularly concerned over a message from
Army commander General Abdel Fatah al-Sissi, that Islamist guerrillas, believed to be drawn
primarily from the Sawarki Bedouin tribe, had launched an attack on a base of the International
Peacekeeping Force (IPF) in the Sinai. The General reported that the 1500 United Nations troops at
the base, including some U.S. forces, were under heavy attack and casualty figures were not yet
known. Morsi stated that this fight was an example of radical anti-government forces and Salafist
Islamist dissidents taking advantage of the current situation to carry out attacks that demonstrate his
government is unable to protect Western personnel and facilities in Egypt. Morsi stated that the
success or failure of his regime is directly tied to his ability to establish a moderate Islamic state that
can work with western business interests.
2. (Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, the current wave of violence is related
to an ongoing struggle between Salafist and Sufi Muslims throughout Egypt. What makes it more
frustrating for Morsi is that much of the violence appears to be inspired by members of the Salafist al
Nour Party, the coalition partner of Morsi's Freedom and Justice Party (RIP) in the new Egyptian
Parliament. According to this individual, Morsi delayed condemning the initial attacks on the U.S.

Embassy out of concern that his opponents would use such a statement to move against his
government. Late on the evening of September 13, 2012, Mohammed Badie, the Supreme Guide of
the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood (MB), sent a message to Morsi warning that he and the Supreme
Guidance Council were concerned that the situation around the U.S. Embassy was getting out of
control and that, difficult as it might seem, he had to take tough measures against the demonstrators,
and protect the interests of the U.S. and other Western Governments. In a telephone discussion with
Saad al-Katany, the MB/Freedom and Justice Party (MB/KIP) Speaker of the lower house of
parliament, Morsi admitted that he had felt constrained from acting, given his past history of poor
personal relations with the leaders of al Nour. Al-Katany urged him to gain control of the situation.)
3. On September 14, Morsi also stated to an EU official that he had received extremely forceful
messages from both the U.S. State Department and the Office of the U.S. President, leaving no doubt
in his mind that the U.S. â€”Egyptian relations and more than $1billion in U.S. aid were at stake in this
matter. Morsi added that since much of this aid goes to the Egyptian Army, he and al-Katany agreed
that actions that put it in jeopardy would also damage the new Egyptian administration's current
good relationship with the Army. Accordingly, Morsi instructed the military and security forces to use
all necessary force short of lethal measures to protect U.S. and Western facilities. In a private
conversation, Morsi stated that he felt he is losing control of the political situation and fears that if the
current fighting results in deaths, either of demonstrators, U.S. diplomats, Egyptian security
personnel, or UN peacekeepers, the situation may spin out of control and his government could fall.
Al-Katany agreed, but said that taking no action would guarantee disaster. They agreed that when the
situation calms down they will have to deal with the al Nour party, which they fear will, in the future,
take advantage of circumstances to try to destabilize Morsi's administration. With this in mind, Morsi
ordered al-Sissi to direct the commanders of Military Intelligence (MI -Mukhabarat el-Khabeya) to
step up operations collecting information on the activities of the al Nour leadership, focusing on any
contacts with potentially violent Salafist dissidents.
4. (Source Comment: A separate sensitive source also noted that General al-Sissi is warning
Morsi about press reports that the person who made the controversial internet film at the heart of this
situation is an Egyptian Coptic Christian. The General cautioned that as this report gains wider
circulation, the government and the Army must prepare for violent attacks by Islamists against that
community, which makes up ten (10) percent of the Egyptian population.)
5. A separate sensitive source noted that for his part, al-Sissi is prepared to to have his troops
take harsh measures against any demonstrators who attack Western personnel and facilities. The
General is also concerned that the al Nour leaders are even more dangerous than Morsi realizes, and
he has ordered the MI to increase technical and physical surveillance of these individuals. In
addition, he stated in private that Morsi and al-Katany spoke with Libyan President Mohammed
Yussef el Ma.gariaf, and they had all agreed that military and security officials in Egypt and Libya will
cooperate in an effort to track links between the violence in Cairo and Benghazi. Al-Sissi has ordered
Special Forces units to step up patrols in the Egypt-Libya border region, while the MI will monitor
communications between dissidents; primarily Salafists, in both countries. According to this source
the General is convinced that these dissidents are seizing the opportunity presented by the current
unrest to move against the governments of Morsi and al-Magariaf. He also received permission from
Morsi to step up cooperation with his counterparts in the U.S. and Western Europe to deal with this
situation and al-Sissi believes al-Magariaf has given similar instructions to Libyan military and
security officials.
6. (Source Comment: According to a separate sensitive source, al-Sissi believes that, given his
new orders from Mori, the Army can, for the most part, protect Western facilities and personnel in
Egypt. But the General is concerned that the security services can never completely eliminate the

Person of Interest: United States UN Ambassador Susan Rice
Oct 8, 2012 iloo AM EDT
Leslie H. Gelb
A diplomat under fire.
With the presidential campaign drowning in boredom, commentators were desperately
searching for news, preferably a new victim, to brighten their days. And along came Susan
Rice. A couple Sundays ago, the U.N. ambassador made the mistake of appearing on the talk
shows to insist that the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, was ""spontaneous""
rather than a terrorist plot. You would have thought she had said that the pope was a
Mormon.
Out came the Washington daggers. She lied. She was a shill. Benghazi was no spontaneous
event. It was the work of an al Qaeda offshoot. The White House had fumbled key
intelligence information and was now trying to cover up its unforgivable mistake. Rice was
just covering up for the president. Her reward would be Obama's nominating her to succeed
Hillary Clinton as secretary of State.
The commentariat immediately rolled out plans to nail Rice and the Obama team to the
wall. Peter King, the Grand Inquisitor of the Republicans in the House of Representatives,
pledged to ""investigate"" and hold hearings. And that, said the commentariat, would be the
end of Rice's hopes to become the new Hillary.

Now, let's take an unfashionable step back and examine the facts, such as they are. Rice did
not make up the ""spontaneous"" story or have it handed to her by White House conspirators.
She got it from the same daily intelligence brief given to the president. Those daily intel
reports told the very story Rice repeated publicly, i.e., that the Benghazi mob formed more
or less on its own, mainly in reaction to the American video cartooning sacred Muslim
figures, and that extremists then took advantage to kill, including Ambassador Christopher
Stevens. Rice didn't make up that story. The problem was not with Rice; it was with the
inevitably complicated U.S. intelligence process.
Her mistake was taking the initial intelligence at face value. The White House biiefers made
the same error, and so did I. I too repeated in an op-ed on The Daily Beast what the
intelligence briefers told me, but I knew very well that more and contradictory information
would appear soon enough. It always does.
Sure, the CIA had additional intel from the start, but it hadn't begun to sift through all the
communications intercepts, satellite photos, and human reports. It always takes time to sort
out facts from fictions and find consistent threads. Seemingly, this gossamer information is
now taking shape.
Meantime, Rice is still very much in the running for the job at Fogg' Bottom, along with
Senator John Kerry, NSC Adviser Tom Donilon, and former diplomat Nicholas Burns, now
of Harvard. She was Obama's earliest loyalist in the foreign-policy crowd, and he still likes
her, despite lackluster reports on her performance at the U.N. The smears, though flatly
inaccurate, won't help her either. What will help her and, more importantly a flagging
Obama after the first debate, is hunting down the Benghazi culprits.

Romney has an op-ed in today's Wall Street Journal playing off Stevens' murder to say Obama has put
""security at risk,"" etc.
According to Politico yesterday, there was an internal argument within the Romney campaign over
Libya. Obviously, the neocons and the Rove oriented faction (Ed Gillespie, Rove's surrogate is now a
Romney campaign adviser) beat Stuart Stevens.
Romney is careening from tactic to tactic, hoping something will catch.
I wouldn't be surprised to see Romney raise the specter of the Muslim Brotherhood in charge of Egypt
& Libya as a bogeyman. I have heard him do this within the last week.

According to a highly reliable source, as Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama prepare for the
first presidential debate Wednesday night, top Republican operatives are primed to unleash a new
two-pronged offensive that will attack Obama as weak on national security, and will be based, in part
on new intelligence information regarding the attacks in Libya that killed U.S. ambassador Chris
Stevens on September it.
The source, who has first-hand knowledge of private, high-level conversations in the Romney camp
that took place in Washington, DC last week, said that at various times the GOP strategists referred to
their new operation as the Jimmy Carter Strategy or the October Surprise.
He added that they planned to release what they hoped would be ""a bombshell"" that would make
Libya and Obamta's foreign policy a major issue in the campaign. ""My understanding is that they have
come up with evidence that the Obama administration had positive intelligence that there was going
to be a terrorist attack on the intelligence.""
The source described the Republicans as chortling with glee that the Obama administration
""definitely had inter about the attack before it happened. ""Intelligence can be graded in different
ways,"" he added, 'and sometimes A and B don't get connected. But [the Romney campaign] will try to
paint it to look like Obama had advance knowledge of the attack and is weak on terrorism.""
He said they were jubilant about their new strategy and said they intended to portray Obama as a
helpless, Jimmy Carter-like president and to equate the tragedy in Libya with President Carter's failed
attempt to rescue American hostages in Iran in 1980. ""They are so excited about it,"" he said ""Over
and over again they talked about how it would be just like Jimmy Carter's failed raid. They feel it is
going to give them a last-minute landslide in the election.""
The source, however, said he was dubious about the tactic. ""To me, it is indicative that they have lost
touch with a huge portion of the electorate,"" he said.
The source declined to reveal the names of the GOP operatives who were present But he said, ""These
were the top guys in the party. It was a private, unguarded planning conversation."" He further
described participants in the meeting as consisting of well-known names tied to the big Republican
super PACs and people who had access to high-level national security. intelligence.
""As usual, Karl Rove wasn't present,"" he said, ""but some were close to Rove.""
The source said that ""there was quite a bit more"" to the operation than simply revealing the
intelligence regarding Libya. He declined to discuss what he described as the second phase of the
operation.
However, already there is evidence that the first phase of the operation is underway. On Wednesday,
September 26, on Fox News, Karl Rove called Obarna's reaction to what happened in Libya
""inexplicable"" and added that Obama is ""more intent on campaigning than meeting his
responsibilities as commander-in-chief."" He went on to warn that Obama's policies in Libya
endangered the U.S. with regard to Iran, ""I am astonished,"" Rove said ""We are projecting weakness
when we need to be projecting strength.""
Similarly, former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a one-time GOP presidential hopeful who
became known as the mayor of 9/11, followed Rove in criticizing Obama on the attack in Libya. ""This
is a deliberate attempt to cover up the truth, from an administration that claimed it wanted to be the
most transparent in history,"" he told Fox News. ""And it's the worst kind of cover-up: the kind of
cover-up that involves our national security. This is a cover-up that involves the slaughter of four
Americans.""
Giuliani added that the Obama White House wanted to dismiss the role played by al-Qaeda because it
seemed to diminish the triumph of having killed Osama bin Laden. ""1 think it's because they have this
narrative that they defeated al-Qaeda,"" he said ""They never say the words 'Islamic fundamentalist

terrorism'. They want to wish it away. The president was moving on to Asia - he was going to declare
this a great victory for himself and unfortunately, this terrible act of terror intervened in their very
convenient narrative.""
Likewise, Bob Corker, Republican senator from Tennessee, described the administration's response to
""the terrorist attack"" in Libya as ""bizarre."" And on Sunday, September 30, both Mitt Romney and
vice-presidential nominee Paul Ryan joined in the attacks. ""I think they want to do their very best to
keep the people of America from understanding exactly what happened. We expect candor, we expect
transparency, particularly as it relates to terrorism,"" Romney said.
Added Ryan, ""Why is he (Mama) not on the same page with his own administration officials who are
saying that this is a terrorist attack? We'll leave it up to you to decide whether it's a cover-up or not""
In an apparently related development, a Politico article posted last night said Romney advisers were
divided over how aggressively to attack President Obama over his handling of the events in Libya. One
unnamed Romney adviser described them as ""a huge gift"" to the campaign. ""Across the board -
domestic, economic and foreign-policy issues - President Mama has been outmatched by events,"" he
said. ""He's an observer of events, not a shaper of events. Everywhere you look, he's been outmatched.""
But other Romney advisers, led by media strategist Stuart Stevens, wanted to stick to the economy as
the central issue. ""They'll tell you that you've got to focus people on the fact that their economic
prospects are not very good and all that,"" the aide told Politico. ""Well, Romney's been trying to do that
now since he clinched the nomination at the end of April â€” and he's failed. The president is better at
deflecting attention from the bad news than Romney is at driving home the impact of the bad news on
individual voters.""

This is it. Pretty uncompelling piece if you ask me, but of course I'm biased.
Mitt Romney: A New Course for the Middle East
Restore the three sinews of American influence: our economic strength, our military strength and the strength of our values.
Disturbing developments are sweeping across the greater Middle East. In Syria, tens of thousands of innocent people have been slaughtered. In Egypt, the Muslim
Brotherhood has come to power, and the country's peace treaty with Israel hangs In the balance. In Libya, our ambassador was murdered In a terrorist attack. U.S.
embassies throughout the region have been stormed in violent protests. And in Iran, the ayatollahs continue to move full tilt toward nuclear-weapons capability, all
the while promising to annihilate Israel.
These developments are not, as President Obama says, mere ""bumps in the road."" They are major issues that put our security at risk.
Yet amid this upheaval, our country seems to be at the mercy of events rather than shaping them. We're not moving them in a direction that protects our people or
our allies.
And that's dangerous. If the Middle East descends into chaos, if Iran moves toward nuclear breakout, or if Israel's security is compromised, America could be
pulled into the maelstrom.
We still have time to address these threats, but it will require a new strategy toward the Middle East
The first step is to understand how we got here. Since World War II, America has been the leader of the Free World. We're unique in having earned that role not
through conquest but through promoting human rights, free markets and the rule of law. We ally ourselves with like-minded countries, expand prosperity through
trade and keep the peace by maintaining a military second to none.
But in recent years, President Obama has allowed our leadership to atrophy. Our economy is stuck in a ""recovery"" that barely deserves the name. Our national
debt has risen to record levels. Our military, tested by a decade of war, is facing devastating cuts thanks to the budgetary games played by the White House.
Finally, our values have been misappliedâ€”and misunderstoodâ€”by a president who thinks that weakness will win favor with our adversaries.
By failing to maintain the elements of our influence and by stepping away from our allies, President Obama has heightened the prospect of conflict and instability.
He does not understand that an American policy that lacks resolve can provoke aggression and encourage disorder.
The Middle East is a case in point. The Arab Spring presented an opportunity to help move millions of people from oppression to freedom. But it also presented
grave risks. We needed a strategy for success, but the president offered none. And now he seeks to downplay the significance of the calamities of the past few
weeks
The same incomprehension afflicts the president's policy toward Israel. The president began his term with the explicit policy of creating ""daylight"" between our two
countries. He recently downgraded Israel from being our ""closest ally"" in the Middle East to being only ""one of our closest allies."" It's a diplomatic message that will
be received clearly by Israel and its adversaries alike. He dismissed Israel's concerns about Iran as mere ""noise"" that he prefers to ""block out."" And at a time when
Israel needs America to stand with it, he declined to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
In this period of uncertainty, we need to apply a coherent strategy of supporting our partners in the Middle Eastâ€”that is, both governments and individuals who
share our values.
This means restoring our credibility with Iran. When we say an Iranian nuclear-weapons capabilityâ€”and the regional instability that comes with it--is unacceptable,
the ayatollahs must be made to believe us.
It means placing no daylight between the United States and Israel, And it means using the full spectrum of our soft power to encourage liberty and opportunity for
those who have for too long known only corruption and oppression. The dignity of work and the ability to steer the course of their lives are the best alternatives to
extremism.
But this Middle East policy will be undermined unless we restore the three sinews of our influence: our economic strength, our military strength and the strength Of
our values. That will require a very different set of policies from those President Obama is pursuing.

The 20th century became an American Century because we were steadfast in defense of freedom. We made the painful sacrifices necessary to defeat
totalitarianism In all of Its guises.. To defend ourselves and our allies, we paid the price in treasure and in soldiers who never came home.
Our challenges are different now, but if the 21st century is to be another American Century, we need leaders who understand that keeping the peace requires
American strength in all of its dimensions.

Statement by the Press Secretary
As is common practice for this and all Administrations, I am not going to comment on intelligence matters I
will reiterate what the President said yesterday - no decision has been made about providing arms to the
opposition or to any group in Libya. We're not ruling it out or ruling it in. We're assessing and reviewing
options for all types of assistance that we could provide to the Libyan people, and have consulted directly with
the opposition and our international partners about these matters.

Cheryl, I can't imagine what this week has been like for you but wanted to write after attending the Andrews ceremony
today. I was with some NEA hands who knew Chris well and they all noted the Secretary's visit to their offices earlier in
the week and how pitch-perfect this has been handled. The remarks today were beautiful and moving. I did not have a
personal connection to the four lost this week but the President and Secretary seemed to be speaking as well to those I
did know and still mourn. So I wanted to write to say thank you This is among the most challenging and uncertain
periods in our history -- and our nation is more fortunate than it knows to have such a steady team at the helm.

RE: gorgeous pie on the front page of the NWT!
Bic sending more arms into a society generally â€” particularly when they are as disorganized and fragmented as they are
â€” will result in more violence â€” against each other. Boys like to play with guns (trust me as the mother of sons). I am all
for saying we have no objection to French doing it to increase pressure on Gaddafi, but in a tribal society where conflicts
have been repressed for so long, adding even more weapons does not make sense. Obviously they can get weapons
from other places, but nb that they are not awash in weapons now. I wrote something for New York Review of Books
this week that builds on my farewell remarks and I think you will like it; will send it to you for weekend reading,

Stephens: Benghazi Was Obama's 3 a.m. Call
Libya was a failure of policy and worldview, not intelligence.
Why won't the Libya story go away? Why can't the memory of U.S. Ambassador Chris
Stevens and his staff be consigned to the same sad-and-sealed file of Americans killed abroad
in dangerous line of duty? How has an episode that seemed at first to have been mishandled by
the Romney camp become an emblem of a feckless and deluded foreign policy?
The story-switching and stonewalling haven't helped. But let's start a little earlier.
The hour is 5 p.m., Sept. 11, Washington time, and the scene is an Oval Office meeting among
President Â°barna, the secretary of defense, the national security adviser and the chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi has been under assault for
roughly 90 minutes. Some 30 U.S. citizens are at mortal risk. The whereabouts of Ambassador
Stevens are unknown.
What is uppermost on the minds of the president and his advisers? The safety of Americans,
no doubt. So what are they prepared to do about it? Here is The Wall Street Journal's account
of the meeting:
""There was no serious consideration at that hour of intervention with military force, officials
said. Doing so without Libya's permission could represent a violation of sovereignty and

inflame the situation, they said. Instead, the State Department reached out to the Libyan
government to get reinforcements to the scene.""
So it did. Yet the attack was far from over. After leaving the principal U.S. compound, the
Americans retreated to a second, supposedly secret facility, which soon came under deadly
mortar fire. Time to call in the troops?
""Some officials said the U.S. could also have sent aircraft to the scene as a 'show of force' to
scare off the attackers,"" the Journal reported, noting that there's a U.S. air base just 450 miles
away in Sicily. ""State Department officials dismissed the suggestions as unrealistic. 'They
would not have gotten there in two hours, four hours or six hours.""
The U.S. security detail only left Washington at 8 a.m. on Sept. 12, more than 10 hours after
the attacks began. A commercial jet liner can fly from D.C. to Benghazi in about the same
time.
All this is noted with the benefit of hindsight, and the administration deserves to be judged
accordingly. But it also deserves to be judged in light of what it knew prior to the attack,
including an attack on the mission in June and heightened threat warnings throughout the
summer.
So how did the administration do on that count? ""That the local security did so well back in
June probably gave us a false sense of security,"" an unnamed American official who has
served in Libya told the New York Times last week.
The logic here is akin to supposing that because the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center
failed to bring down the towers, nobody need have been concerned thereafter. But let's still
make allowances for the kind of bureaucratic ineptitude that knows neither administration nor
political party.
The more serious question is why the administration alighted on the idea that the attack wasn't
a terrorist act at all. Also, what did the White House think it had to gain by adopting the
jihadist narrative that a supposedly inflammatory video clip was at the root of the trouble?
Nobody can say. All the administration will acknowledge is that it has ""revised [its] initial
assessment to reflect new information that it was a deliberate and organized terrorist attack.""
That's from James Clapper, the director of national intelligence. It suggests that our
intelligence agencies are either much dumber than previously supposed (always a strong
possibility) or much more politicized (equally plausible).
No doubt the administration would now like to shift blame to Mr. Clapper. But what happened
in Benghazi was not a failure of intelligence. It was a failure of policy, stemming from a
flawed worldview and the political needs of an election season.
Let's review:
The U.S. ignores warnings of a parlous security situation in Benghazi. Nothing happens
because nobody is really paying attention, especially in an election year, and because Libya is
supposed to be a foreign-policy success. When something does happen, the administration's
concerns for the safety of Americans are subordinated to considerations of Libyan
""sovereignty"" and the need for ""permission."" After the attack the administration blames a
video, perhaps because it would be politically inconvenient to note that al Qaeda is far from

defeated, and that we are no more popular under Mr. Obarna than we were under George W.
Bush. Denouncing the video also appeals to the administration's reflexive habits of blaming
America first. Once that story falls apart, it's time to blame the intel munchkins and move on.

EXCLUSIVE: Bill Clinton Says He Wouldn't Rule Out Arming
Libya's Rebels
Pm Just Speaking For Myself, Former President Says
By SUZAN CLARICE
April 3, 2011 â€”
Former U.S. President Bill Clinton said he thinks the United States should consider arming the rebels in Libya's
civil war.
""It would depend ... and I might need to know a little more, but I would be inclined to do it,"" Clinton told
correspondent Bianna Golodryga today in San Diego during an exclusive interview with ABC News.
Clinton was in San Diego for his annual Clinton Global Initiative University Meeting.
The uprising in Libya stared in February during a wave of social and political unrest in the Middle East.
Fighting has escalated all across the country, but the rebels have found themselves outgunned by Libyan leader
Col. Moamrnar Gadhafi's forces, which are better equipped.
Last month the United Nations authorized a no-fly zone over the North African nation to prevent further attacks
on civilians from Gadhafiss troops in the air.
Clinton on Arming Rebels: 'I Sure Wouldn't Shut the Door to It'
The United States backed the no-fly zone and has also authorized additional support for the anti-Gad hafi
fighters, but key U.S. lawmakers and top officials in the government of President Barack Obanaa have said they
are not comfortable with arming the rebels -- apparently because not enough is known about then
But Clinton said he wouldn't completely rule out the idea of supplying arms to Libya's rebels.

""I'm just speaking from myself. But I certainly wouldn't take that off the table, too,"" he said.

Subject: Tripoli trip
Here are some highlights from Tripoli. Every meeting started with condolences on Chris Stevens and his three
colleagues, and concern that Benghazi would permanently alter US Libyan relations. I used the fact of the Secretary's
meeting with President Magaref in NY last week and Deputy secretary Burns' Tripoli visit as the best evidence of US
determination to continue To build the relationship with this new democracy. In addition:
- FBI INVESTIGATION: With the PM, DFM and Judicial leaders, I placed heavy emphasis on the importance of Libyan
cooperation and transparency in the investigation. This was my primary focus; I stressed the point that Libya's
performance will no doubt color American views on Libya at a time when Libya will want to burnish its reputation.
- SECURITY: I stressed that social stability and economic growth will depend on a dramatic improvement in security. All
agreed without
hesitation. All said that Libya needs outside assistance, but when we
discussed details of how to move forward on the bilateral programs we already have underway, each was quick to
identify specific stumbling blocks on each Especially with the Acting FM, we also identified next steps.
- TRAINING: We made progress on 1208, CBW, and MANPADS training programs - details to follow front channel. We
will also follow up on judicial exchanges and forensic training.
- NEW GOVT FORMATION: Abushagur described the negotiation process as the single most difficult professional
challenge he has ever faced. He told us the government would be ready by October 3. Even though others warned us
he would miss that deadline due to difficulty in reconciling the competing demands of various parties and individuals, he
obviously made good on his Oct. 3 announcement undertaking.
- DDR: Abushagur said there are three main groups of militants to
reintegrate: part have jobs, part are heading back to university, and part will be offered vocational training. He said he
will create a new Ministry of Human Development to oversee DDR; it's unclear how this new ministry will relate to
numerous other GOL. efforts on this He expressed concern about the approximately 17,000 criminals released by
Qacihafi, some of whom joined militias.
- TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE: The political leaders and judges all pledged to strike a balance between respecting the rights
of detainees and holding human rights violators accountable. They acknowledged the profound limitations of their
justice system.

- UNSMIL: I had a very good two hr meeting with General Smith to discuss how we can partner to help the new Libyan
government improve security. He has good ideas on which we'll work closely.
I had separate meetings with PM-elect Abushagur, Acting/Deputy FM Abdel Aziz, Supreme Court President Al Dhan,
Deputy Prosecutor General Hassadi, NFA Party leader Jibril, UNSMIL Security Advisor General Smith, JCP (Muslim
Brotherhood) Party political director Elbenanni, and civil society leaders.
Morale at post is understandably rocky, but people are coping and continue to work hard in very difficult circumstances.
There are some specific issues that the Department has already solved and others on which we can work to help the
embassy in its determination to advance USG goals.
I leave for Cairo in a few minutes tonight.

Person of Interest: United States UN Ambassador Susan Rice
Oct 8, 2012 iloo AM EDT
Leslie H. Gelb
A diplomat under fire.
With the presidential campaign drowning in boredom, commentators were desperately
searching for news, preferably a new victim, to brighten their days. And along came Susan
Rice. A couple Sundays ago, the U.N. ambassador made the mistake of appearing on the talk
shows to insist that the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, was ""spontaneous""
rather than a terrorist plot. You would have thought she had said that the pope was a
Mormon.
Out came the Washington daggers. She lied. She was a shill. Benghazi was no spontaneous
event. It was the work of an al Qaeda offshoot. The White House had fumbled key
intelligence information and was now trying to cover up its unforgivable mistake. Rice was
just covering up for the president. Her reward would be Obama's nominating her to succeed
Hillary Clinton as secretary of State.
The commentariat immediately rolled out plans to nail Rice and the Obama team to the
wall. Peter King, the Grand Inquisitor of the Republicans in the House of Representatives,
pledged to ""investigate"" and hold hearings. And that, said the commentariat, would be the
end of Rice's hopes to become the new Hillary.

Now, let's take an unfashionable step back and examine the facts, such as they are. Rice did
not make up the ""spontaneous"" story or have it handed to her by White House conspirators.
She got it from the same daily intelligence brief given to the president. Those daily intel
reports told the very story Rice repeated publicly, i.e., that the Benghazi mob formed more
or less on its own, mainly in reaction to the American video cartooning sacred Muslim
figures, and that extremists then took advantage to kill, including Ambassador Christopher
Stevens. Rice didn't make up that story. The problem was not with Rice; it was with the
inevitably complicated U.S. intelligence process.
Her mistake was taking the initial intelligence at face value. The White House biiefers made
the same error, and so did I. I too repeated in an op-ed on The Daily Beast what the
intelligence briefers told me, but I knew very well that more and contradictory information
would appear soon enough. It always does.
Sure, the CIA had additional intel from the start, but it hadn't begun to sift through all the
communications intercepts, satellite photos, and human reports. It always takes time to sort
out facts from fictions and find consistent threads. Seemingly, this gossamer information is
now taking shape.
Meantime, Rice is still very much in the running for the job at Fogg' Bottom, along with
Senator John Kerry, NSC Adviser Tom Donilon, and former diplomat Nicholas Burns, now
of Harvard. She was Obama's earliest loyalist in the foreign-policy crowd, and he still likes
her, despite lackluster reports on her performance at the U.N. The smears, though flatly
inaccurate, won't help her either. What will help her and, more importantly a flagging
Obama after the first debate, is hunting down the Benghazi culprits.

Subject: RE: Itenghazi and NATO
Ivo, thanks for the helpful response. From NEA's perspective, an operational liaison with the TNC does
not constitute formal, legal recognition of the INC as the government of Libya. We don't consider
Chris Stevens' presence in Benghazi to trigger formal recognition, and we've never broken relations
with Libya despite suspending our embassy operations.
Without question, having a NATO liaison in Benghazi would have the appearance of NATO leaning in
the direction of the INC. But NATO's operations already show a considerable lean away from
Qadhati. Speaking for NEA, I don't mind the appearance. But the real purpose would be to avoid
friendly fire incidents, of course.
Cheers,
Jeff

Editor's Note: Stephen Prothero, a Boston University religion scholar and author of ""The American Bible:
How Our Words Unite, Divide, and Define a Nation,"" is a regular CAW Belief Blog contributor.
By Stephen Prothero, Special to CNN
What should we make of the attacks on the U.S. consulates in Egypt, Libya and Yemen, and the deaths of
four Americans, including U.S. ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens?
It depends on who you mean by ""we.""
From the perspective of those who stormed the embassies, taking down the American flag in Egypt and
replacing it with a black flag reading, -'rhere is no God but Allah and Mohammed is his messenger,"" theirs was
an act of justice on behalf of the One True Faith.
The Americans had it coming, according to this view, because Americans are on the wrong side in the clash of
civilizations between the Judeo-Christian West and the Muslim world. And the creation of an anti-Islamic video
(ironically entitled ""Innocence of Muslims"") by a producer thought to be an American provided the catalyst
(or excuse) for the protests.
Why Muslims are sensitive about portraying the Prophet Mohammed
Most Americans operate by a different ""we.."" From our perspective, the assault was an unjust and cowardly
attack on (among other things) the rule of law, the institution of diplomacy and the right of free speech.
Libyan Deputy Prime Minister Mustafa Abushagur gave voice to this perspective when he said on Twitter, ""I
condemn these barbaric attacks in the strongest possible terms. This is an attack on America, Libya and free
people everywhere.""
""Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted on the
Internet,"" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton added. ""The United States deplores any intentional effort to
denigrate the religious beliefs of others. Our commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning
of our nation.""

In a commencement speech at Kenyon College in 2005, later published as ""This Is Water,"" novelist David
Foster Wallace urged student to scrutinize the ""natural, basic self-centeredness"" that puts ""me"" at the center of
the world.
This unconscious ""default setting"" fosters the sort of ""blind certainty"" that manifests as arrogant atheism and
fundamentalism alike, Wallace said. And the point of education is to shake us out of that ""default setting"" â€” to
begin to see things from the perspectives of others.
Follow the CNN Belief Blog on Twitter
Wallace focused in his speech on the individual ""I."" But his critique can be applied as well to another ""default
setting"" (this one more cultural than natural): our tendency to understand the world from the perspective of
""we.11
According to those who stormed the embassies, ""Innocence of Muslims"" was not made by an individual
(whoever the shadowy ""Sam Bacile"" may â€” or may not â€” be). It was made by anAmerican.
Moreover, according to this groupthink, Americans as a group are responsible for the sins of individual
Americans, so it makes perfect sense to strike out at embassy personnel who issued a statement before the
protests turned deadly, condemning ""the continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious
feelings of Muslims, as we condemn efforts to offend believers of all religions.""
CNN's Belief Blog: The faith angles behind the biggest stories
Meanwhile, the shadowy figures who produced and distributed ""Innocence of Muslims"" are imprisoned in some
groupthink of their own, which gathers all the world's Muslims under the category of an evil Islamic empire.
Their film doesn't just depict Mohammed as a con man, philanderer, and pedophile. It portrays his followers as
dupes.
Unfortunately, the events of recent days have done nothing to jar the alleged producer out of this default setting.
When questioned about his film in the aftermath of the Libyan and Egyptian attacks, a man identifying himself
as ""Sam Bacile"" reportedly told the Wall Street Journal that ""Islam is a cancer.""
You don't need a Kenyon college degree to see how this vicious cycle of provocation and violence is fueled,
and you don't need to be a moral relativist to see that it takes two sides to keep it running.
I am an American who is justly proud of the First Amendment and its protections of freedom of speech and
religion. And I believe that killing your opponents in the name of God or nation is a far greater offense than
offending them with an ignorant movie.
Nonetheless, the root problem on display here is in my view what Wallace denounced as ""blind certainty.""
Our world is not divided first and foremost along religious or national lines, into Muslims and Christians and
Hindus or Israelis and Americans and Egyptians.
Neither is it divided into secularists and people of faith â€” the New Atheists and partisans of old-time religion.
The real ""red line"" in the modern world divides the certain from the uncertain. And in the tragic events of recent
days, those who produced and distributed this hateful movie stand on the same side of this line as the killers of
innocents in Libya and Egypt.
Both groups are possessed by the unholy spirit of ""blind certainty,"" unacquainted with both the complexity and
contradictions of life on Earth and the ""cloud of unknowing"" that hovers over every major religion.

The great religious thinkers in Judaism, Christianity and Islam always knew enough to know that they did not
know everything.
They knew the difference between the eternal decrees of the God of Abraham and the all-too-flawed thoughts of
ordinary people. They knew, in short, that they are not God, who alone is charged with creating and destroying
the world and discriminating along the way between the real and the illusory.
The killers in Libya have forgotten that. So have the not-so-innocent producers and distributors of ""Innocence
of Islam.""

Re: Libya cabinet politics
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the
highest levels of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1. As of October 5, 2012 Mohammed Yussef el Magariaf, the new interim President of Libya
told senior advisors that the abortive efforts to form a cabinet under new Prime Minister Mustafa
Abushagur represent the first step in the next phase of the struggle for control of the new Libyan
Government. According to a sensitive source Magariaf is concerned that Abushagur, supported by the
Muslim Brotherhood's (MB) Justice and Construction Party (jCP), as well as certain of the other
more traditional Islamist groups, is looking to establish day to day administrative control the new
government while defining Magariaf as a ceremonial Head of State.
2. According to this individual, the President, who is not affiliated with a particular party
holding seats in the General National Council (GNC), spoke with the new Prime Minister immediately
after Abushagur was elected by the GNC on September 12. At that time Magariaf advised him to
include in his government members of former Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril's National Forces
Alliance (NFA), Abushagar having only narrowly defeated Jibril in the GNC vote. At that time
Magariaf was not aware of the fact that Jibril had already demanded 9 cabinet seats for the NFA;
however, he did point out that even Jibril's more moderate followers were committed to the idea of a
modern Islamic state and would fit into the new cabinet . The President came away from this

discussion with the impression that Abushagur and his supporters intend to marginalize Jibril and
the 39 Members of Parliament (MP) controlled by the NFA, concentrating instead on working with
the 120 independent MPs in the GNC, looking to establish a more conservative administration. This
individual added that Abushagur made it clear that while the President was free to choose his Vice
President and staff, the Prime Minister would choose the national cabinet, supported by the GNC.
3. (Source Comment: According to this individual, Magariaf is allowing the current crisis in
the Abushagur administration to play out without direct interference. He is convinced that the desire
of the Libyan people for peace and stability, which brought him to power, added to the need to
balance the regional and political rivalries throughout the country, will lead to the formation of a
cabinet that is acceptable to all parties. Magariaf also believes that these developments will eventually
leave him as the dominant figure in the government.)
4. In addition, this individual added that Magariaf is seized with the national security
situation, the ongoing effort to disarm militia units, and the investigation of the murder of the United
States Ambassador. All of these efforts are related to what he sees as his most important role,
rebuilding the confidence of the international business community in its ability to operate in Libya
safely and efficiently. To this end he does agree with Abushagur that it is important to replace the
cabinet of former Prime Minister Abdel Rahman el-Keib, particularly Minister of Oil Abdulrahman
Ben Yazza, whose connections to the regime of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi, and the Italian
Oil firm ENI made him unacceptable to the JCP and other conservative parties. That said, this
individual notes that Magariaf was surprised and not pleased with the appointment to the ministry of
Mabrouk Issa Abu Harroura, another technical expert, who previously worked for Libya's Zueitina Oil
Company as well as in the oil sector abroad. Magariaf feels that Abu Harroura does not have the
standing among the foreign oil companies that Ben Yezza enjoyed, although he was more acceptable
to a number of the conservative members of the GNC.
5. Magariaf was pleased that the Prime Minister, after dramatic confrontations with MPs and
demonstrators who entered the GNC chamber, withdrew his cabinet nominations. The President
again advised Abushagur to name former Oil and Finance Minister Ali Tarhouni to the Oil Ministry
post; however, he fears that that Ali Tarhouni is seen as too close to Western governments to gain
acceptance in the GNC. Magariaf is concerned that, while the new cabinet Abushagur plans to put
forward on October 7 may contain some members of the NFA and other moderate groups, it will still
be dominated by the JCP and conservative elements, and will again fail to gain acceptance, leading to
a real government crisis.

6. According to this individual Magariaf and his advisors knew in advance that more than loo
protesters planned to enter the GNC session on October 4, in an effort to prevent MPs from convening
to vote on the new cabinet. While Magariaf did not directly influence these protesters he did nothing
to warn or advise Abushagur on the developing situation In particular, the protestors objected to the
failure of the Prime Minister to name any minister from the Zawiya region. Although the
demonstrators eventually left the hall, a number of the independent MPs, who had said they would
support the new cabinet, were shaken by the incident and changed their positions. In the end,
according to this individual, Abushagur's efforts to rally their support failed, and he was forced to
withdraw all of the nominees, promising to submit a new list on October 7, one that would take into
account regional and political considerations.
7. In the opinion of a particularly sensitive source, the failure of Abushagur to name any NFA
ministers to the new cabinet will continue to complicate the matter. For his part Magariaf is
concerned over international perceptions regarding the nature of the new Libyan government. In this
regard, he fears that the Western press is too sharply focused on the fact that the NFA holds the
largest single bloc of votes in the GNC (38), missing the fact that the real power in the parliament lies
with the 120 independent deputies, who tend to be somewhat conservative on religious and social
matters, while focusing primarily on local political issues. Magariaf believes that the appointment of
All Tarhouni, or another liberal not associated with the NFA, would serve to reassure Western
business and government leaders while demonstrating political balance to the Libyan people.
Although he continues to make this point, the President has no indication that Abushagur will follow
his advice. He does expect Abushagur to again select a majority of cabinet ministers associated with
the MB and the JCP.
8. (Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, Magariaf will remain focused on the security
situation, particularly as he is having some success disarming the militias following the death of the U.S.
Ambassador. According to this individual, Magariaf believes he must end the power of the regional militia
forces before the Libyan economy can improve. The President knows that foreign companies are the key to
Libyan oil production, but he fears that they will not increase their commitment to Libya until the government
can insure the security of their personnel and facilities. In a final note, this individual added that the Italian
goverment is stepping up its activities in Libya, and the President expects them to pressure to Abushagur
appoint an individual like Ben Yezza to the Oil Ministry, where he can favor ENI and other Italian firms.)

Re: Libya cabinet politics
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as
the highest levels of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1. As of October 5, 2012 Mohammed Yussef el Magariaf, the new interim President of
Libya told senior advisors that the abortive efforts to form a cabinet under new Prime Minister
Mustafa Abushagur represent the first step in the next phase of the struggle for control of the
new Libyan Government. According to a sensitive source Magariaf is concerned that
Abushagur, supported by the Muslim Brotherhood's (MB) Justice and Construction Party (JCP),
as well as certain of the other more traditional Islamist groups, is looking to establish day to day
administrative control the new government while defining Magariaf as a ceremonial Head of
State.
2. According to this individual, the President, who is not affiliated with a particular party
holding seats in the General National Council (GNC), spoke with the new Prime Minister
immediately after Abushagur was elected by the GNC on September 12. At that time Magariaf
advised him to include in his government members of former Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril's
National Forces Alliance (NFA), Abushagar having only narrowly defeated Jibril in the GNC
vote. At that time Magariaf was not aware of the fact that Jibril had already demanded 9 cabinet
seats for the NFA; however, he did point out that even Jibril's more moderate followers were
committed to the idea of a modern Islamic state and would fit into the new cabinet . The

President came away from this discussion with the impression that Abushagur and his supporters
intend to marginalize Jibril and the 39 Members of Parliament (MP) controlled by the NFA,
concentrating instead on working with the 120 independent MPs in the GNC, looking to
establish a more conservative administration. This individual added that Abushagur made it
clear that while the President was free to choose his Vice President and staff, the Prime Minister
would choose the national cabinet, supported by the GNC.
3. (Source Comment: According to this individual, Magariaf is allowing the current
crisis in the Abushagur administration to play out without direct interference. He is convinced
that the desire of the Libyan people for peace arid stability, which brought him to power, added
to the need to balance the regional and political rivalries throughout the country, will lead to the
formation of a cabinet that is acceptable to all parties. Magariaf also believes that these
developments will eventually leave him as the dominant figure in the government.)
4. In addition, this individual added that Magariaf is seized with the national security
situation, the ongoing effort to disarm militia units, and the investigation of the murder of the
United States Ambassador. All of these efforts are related to what he sees as his most important
role, rebuilding the confidence of the international business community in its ability to operate in
Libya safely and efficiently. To this end he does agree with Abushagur that it is important to
replace the cabinet of former Prime Minister Abdel Rahman el-Keib, particularly Minister of Oil
Abdulrahrnan Ben Yazza, whose connections to the regime of former dictator Muammar al
Qaddafi, and the Italian Oil firm ENI made him unacceptable to the JCP and other conservative
parties. That said, this individual notes that Magariaf was surprised and not pleased with the
appointment to the ministry of Mabrouk Issa Abu Harroura, another technical expert, who
previously worked for Libya's Zueitina Oil Company as well as in the oil sector abroad.
Magariaf feels that Abu Harroura does not have the standing among the foreign oil companies
that Ben Yezza enjoyed, although he was more acceptable to a number of the conservative
members of the GNC.
5. Magariaf was pleased that the Prime Minister, after dramatic confrontations with MPs
and demonstrators who entered the GNC chamber, withdrew his cabinet nominations. The

President again advised Abushagur to name former Oil and Finance Minister Ali Tarhouni to the
Oil Ministry post; however, he fears that that Ali Tarhouni is seen as too close to Western
governments to gain acceptance in the GNC. Magariaf is concerned that, while the new cabinet
Abushagur plans to put forward on October 7 may contain some members of the NFA and other
moderate groups, it will still be dominated by the JCP and conservative elements, and will again
fail to gain acceptance, leading to a real government crisis.
6. According to this individual Magariaf and his advisors knew in advance that more
than 100 protesters planned to enter the GNC session on October 4, in an effort to prevent MPs
from convening to vote on the new cabinet. While Magariaf did not directly influence these
protesters he did nothing to warn or advise Abushagur on the developing situation. In particular,
the protestors objected to the failure of the Prime Minister to name any minister from the Zawiya
region. Although the demonstrators eventually left the hall, a number of the independent MPs,
who had said they would support the new cabinet, were shaken by the incident and changed their
positions. In the end, according to this individual, Abushagur's efforts to rally their support
failed, and he was forced to withdraw all of the nominees, promising to submit a new list on
October 7, one that would take into account regional and political considerations.
7. In the opinion of a particularly sensitive source, the failure of Abushagur to name any
NFA ministers to the new cabinet will continue to complicate the matter. For his part Magariaf
is concerned over international perceptions regarding the nature of the new Libyan government.
In this regard, he fears that the Western press is too sharply focused on the fact that the NFA
holds the largest single bloc of votes in the GNC (38), missing the fact that the real power in the
parliament lies with the 120 independent deputies, who tend to be somewhat conservative on
religious and social matters, while focusing primarily on local political issues. Magariaf believes
that the appointment of Ali Tarhouni, or another liberal not associated with the NFA, would
serve to reassure Western business and government leaders while demonstrating political balance
to the Libyan people. Although he continues to make this point, the President has no indication
that Abushagur will follow his advice. He does expect Abushagur to again select a majority of
cabinet ministers associated with the MB and the JCP.

the security situation, particularly as he is having some success disarming the militias following

knows that foreign companies are the key to Libyan oil production, but he fears that they will not
increase their commitment to Libya until the government can insure the security of their
personnel and facilities. In a final note, this individual added that the Italian government is
stepping up its activities in Libya, and the President expects them to pressure to Abushagur
appoint an individual like Ben Yezza to the Oil Ministry, where he can favor ENI and other
Italian firms.)

Pm Just Speaking For Myself, Former President Says
By SUZAN CLARICE
April 3, 2011 â€”
Former U.S. President Bill Clinton said he thinks the United States should consider arming the rebels in Libya's
civil war.
""It would depend ... and I might need to know a little more, but I would be inclined to do it,"" Clinton told
correspondent Bianna Golodryga today in San Diego during an exclusive interview with ABC News.
Clinton was in San Diego for his annual Clinton Global Initiative University Meeting.
The uprising in Libya stared in February during a wave of social and political unrest in the Middle East.
Fighting has escalated all across the country, but the rebels have found themselves outgunned by Libyan leader
Col. Moamrnar Gadhafi's forces, which are better equipped.
Last month the United Nations authorized a no-fly zone over the North African nation to prevent further attacks
on civilians from Gadhafiss troops in the air.
Clinton on Arming Rebels: 'I Sure Wouldn't Shut the Door to It'
The United States backed the no-fly zone and has also authorized additional support for the anti-Gad hafi
fighters, but key U.S. lawmakers and top officials in the government of President Barack Obanaa have said they
are not comfortable with arming the rebels -- apparently because not enough is known about then
But Clinton said he wouldn't completely rule out the idea of supplying arms to Libya's rebels.

""Let me just say this. I sure wouldn't shut the door to it. I think ... we may need to know a little more,"" he said.
Clinton, husband of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, stressed that he was speaking without ""any official
sanction"" whatsoever.
""I'm just speaking from myself. But I certainly wouldn't take that off the table, too,"" he said.

Re: Libya cabinet politics
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as
the highest levels of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1. As of October 5, 2012 Mohammed Yussef el Magariaf, the new interim President of
Libya told senior advisors that the abortive efforts to form a cabinet under new Prime Minister
Mustafa Abushagur represent the first step in the next phase of the struggle for control of the
new Libyan Government. According to a sensitive source Magariaf is concerned that
Abushagur, supported by the Muslim Brotherhood's (MB) Justice and Construction Party (JCP),
as well as certain of the other more traditional Islamist groups, is looking to establish day to day
administrative control the new government while defining Magariaf as a ceremonial Head of
State.
2. According to this individual, the President, who is not affiliated with a particular party
holding seats in the General National Council (GNC), spoke with the new Prime Minister
immediately after Abushagur was elected by the GNC on September 12. At that time Magariaf
advised him to include in his government members of former Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril's
National Forces Alliance (NFA), Abushagar having only narrowly defeated Jibril in the GNC
vote. At that time Magariaf was not aware of the fact that Jibril had already demanded 9 cabinet
seats for the NFA; however, he did point out that even Jibril's more moderate followers were
committed to the idea of a modern Islamic state and would fit into the new cabinet. The

President came away from this discussion with the impression that Abushagur and his supporters
intend to marginalize Jibril and the 39 Members of Parliament (MP) controlled by the NFA,
concentrating instead on working with the 120 independent MPs in the GNC, looking to
establish a more conservative administration. This individual added that Abushagur made it
clear that while the President was free to choose his Vice President and staff, the Prime Minister
would choose the national cabinet, supported by the GNC.
3. (Source Comment: According to this individual, Magariaf is allowing the current
crisis in the Abushagur administration to play out without direct interference. He is convinced
that the desire of the Libyan people for peace and stability, which brought him to power, added
to the need to balance the regional and political rivalries throughout the country, will lead to the
formation of a cabinet that is acceptable to all parties. Magariaf also believes that these
developments will eventually leave him as the dominant figure in the government.)
4. In addition, this individual added that Magariaf is seized with the national security
situation, the ongoing effort to disarm militia units, and the investigation of the murder of the
United States Ambassador. All of these efforts are related to what he sees as his most important
role, rebuilding the confidence of the international business community in its ability to operate in
Libya safely and efficiently. To this end he does agree with Abushagur that it is important to
replace the cabinet of former Prime Minister Abdel Rahman el-Keib, particularly Minister of Oil
Abdulrahman Ben Yazza, whose connections to the regime of former dictator Muammar al
Qaddafi, and the Italian Oil firm ENI made him unacceptable to the JCP and other conservative
parties. That said, this individual notes that Magariaf was surprised and not pleased with the
appointment to the ministry of Mabrouk Issa Abu Harroura, another technical expert, who
previously worked for Libya's Zueitina Oil Company as well as in the oil sector abroad.
Magariaf feels that Abu Harroura does not have the standing among the foreign oil companies
that Ben Yezza enjoyed, although he was more acceptable to a number of the conservative
members of the GNC.
5. Magariaf was pleased that the Prime Minister, after dramatic confrontations with MPs
and demonstrators who entered the GNC chamber, withdrew his cabinet nominations. The

President again advised Abushagur to name former Oil and Finance Minister Ali Tarhouni to the
Oil Ministry post; however, he fears that that Ali Tarhouni is seen as too close to Western
governments to gain acceptance in the GNC. Magariaf is concerned that, while the new cabinet
Abushagur plans to put forward on October 7 may contain some members of the NFA and other
moderate groups, it will still be dominated by the JCP and conservative elements, and will again
fail to gain acceptance, leading to a real government crisis.
6. According to this individual Magariaf and his advisors knew in advance that more
than 100 protesters planned to enter the GNC session on October 4, in an effort to prevent MPs
from convening to vote on the new cabinet. While Magariaf did not directly influence these
protesters he did nothing to warn or advise Abushagur on the developing situation. In particular,
the protestors objected to the failure of the Prime Minister to name any minister from the Zawiya
region. Although the demonstrators eventually left the hall, a number of the independent MPs,
who had said they would support the new cabinet, were shaken by the incident and changed their
positions. In the end, according to this individual, Abushagur's efforts to rally their support
failed, and he was forced to withdraw all of the nominees, promising to submit a new list on
October 7, one that would take into account regional and political considerations.
7. In the opinion of a particularly sensitive source, the failure of Abushagur to name any
NFA ministers to the new cabinet will continue to complicate the matter. For his part Magariaf
is concerned over international perceptions regarding the nature of the new Libyan government.
In this regard, he fears that the Western press is too sharply focused on the fact that the NFA
holds the largest single bloc of votes in the GNC (38), missing the fact that the real power in the
parliament lies with the 120 independent deputies, who tend to be somewhat conservative on
religious and social matters, while focusing primarily on local political issues. Magariaf believes
that the appointment of Ali Tarhouni, or another liberal not associated with the NFA, would
serve to reassure Western business and government leaders while demonstrating political balance
to the Libyan people. Although he continues to make this point, the President has no indication
that Abushagur will follow his advice. He does expect Abushagur to again select a majority of
cabinet ministers associated with the MB and the JCP.

8. (Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, Magariaf will remain focused on
the security situation, particularly as he is having some success disarming the militias following
the death of the U.S. Ambassador. According to this individual, Magariaf believes he must end
the power of the regional militia forces before the Libyan economy can improve. The President
knows that foreign companies are the key to Libyan oil production, but he fears that they will not
increase their commitment to Libya until the government can insure the security of their
personnel and facilities. In &final note, this individual added that the Italian government is
stepping up its activities in Libya, and the President expects them to pressure to Abushagur
appoint an individual like Ben Yezza to the Oil Ministry, where he can favor ENI and other
Italian firms.)

Subject: RE: Itenghazi and NATO
Ivo, thanks for the helpful response. From NEA's perspective, an operational liaison with the TNC does
not constitute formal, legal recognition of the INC as the government of Libya. We don't consider
Chris Stevens' presence in Benghazi to trigger formal recognition, and we've never broken relations
with Libya despite suspending our embassy operations.
Without question, having a NATO liaison in Benghazi would have the appearance of NATO leaning in
the direction of the INC. But NATO's operations already show a considerable lean away from
Qadhati. Speaking for NEA, I don't mind the appearance. But the real purpose would be to avoid
friendly fire incidents, of course.
Cheers,

Jeff -
Been in touch with ADMs Stavridis and Locklear. They are working the issue hard, thru both US and UK channels, to
solidify liaison cells with the rebels, The diversity of the opposition makes setting up the contacts more difficult, but the
Nato command is fully engaged in trying to set up the right structure to ensure closest possible coordination between
Naples and the TNC.
Relatedly, FR and UK are pushing the idea of sending a Nato liaison to the TNC to work the PA angle as well as to
provide a way to improve communications between INC and Nato HQ on the bigger picture. Sounds sensible, the we
need to avoid sense that Nato is recognizing TNC or wants role in any political process. Would welcome your thoughts on

Subject: Benghazi and NATO
Ivo et al: Greetings. Please look at points #3 and #4 below, conveyed by DCM Polaschik from
Embassy Tripoli, in exile on Navy Hill) from Chris Stevens, our envoy in Benghazi. This gets at a problem
that S raised with Jake Sullivan and me: coordination between the Libyan INC and NATO. S
expressed deep frustration that there doesn't seem to be an existing, working mechanism for
communication between the INC and NATO (thus leading to mistakes such as attacks on INC
tanks). She asked us to find a way to fix this, now.
The question for you and your colleagues, Ivo, is what would work quickly? Should we rely on the UK
military advisors to do this, as suggested in point 3? Or should we be encouraging the quick
formation of a NATO cell, as suggested in para 4 ( but which at least RADM Foggo suspected might
not work)? Are there other ideas? (Joan, does Chris have views, from his on-the-ground-in--Benghazi
perspective?)
We obviously need a quick, real solution to avoid more friendly fire incidents.

Subject: Stevens Update - April 8 at 1200
SWO â€” could you please pass this to 7th floor principals/staff? DS also needs to see this update
1) Security situation in Benghazi remains quiet. Chris Stevens & team are in the hotel, moving only for meetings as
required.
2) Chris spoke to the RADM Foggo, Deputy Commander of the 6th Fleet, who confirmed that the 6th fleet would be
responsible for the team's evacuation if needed.
3) RADM Foggo was very interested in Chris' meeting with TNC Military Coordinator Abdul Fatah Yunis, particularly

advisors on the ground in Benghazi will help improve this coordination. According to Fogoâ€ž DOD is looking at
ways to improve communications with the INC, while still being mindful of red line re ""boots on the ground.""

4) Separately, Chris has heard from the UK Envoy that the UK and France are recommending that NATO place a
coordination cell with the TNC in order to improve coordination, reduce chances of friendly fire incidents,
etc. UK and France believe that existing coordination on a national level (which according to Chris also includes
the Italians) is not working well. When Chris briefed this to RADM Foggo, Foggo expressed concern that NATO
would not be able to reach agreement on establishment of this kind of coordination cell.

Re: Libya cabinet politics
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the
highest levels of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1. As of October 5, 2012 Mohammed Yussef el Magariaf, the new interim President of Libya
told senior advisors that the abortive efforts to form a cabinet under new Prime Minister Mustafa
Abushagur represent the first step in the next phase of the struggle for control of the new Libyan
Government. According to a sensitive source Magariaf is concerned that Abushagur, supported by the

Muslim Brotherhood's (MB) Justice and Construction Party (JCP), as well as certain of the other
more traditional Islamist groups, is looking to establish day to day administrative control the new
government while defining Magariaf as a ceremonial Head of State.
2. According to this individual, the President, who is not affiliated with a particular party
holding seats in the General National Council (GNC), spoke with the new Prime Minister immediately
after Abushagur was elected by the GNC on September 12. At that time Magariaf advised him to
include in his government members of former Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril's National Forces
Alliance (NFA), Abushagar having only narrowly defeated Jibril in the GNC vote. At that time
Magariaf was not aware of the fact that Jibril had already demanded 9 cabinet seats for the NFA;
however, he did point out that even Jibril's more moderate followers were committed to the idea of a
modern Islamic state and would fit into the new cabinet. The President came away from this
discussion with the impression that Abushagur and his supporters intend to marginalize Jibril and
the 39 Members of Parliament (MP) controlled by the NFA, concentrating instead on working with
the 120 independent MPs in the GNC, looking to establish a more conservative administration. This
individual added that Abushagur made it clear that while the President was free to choose his Vice
President and staff, the Prime Minister would choose the national cabinet, supported by the GNC.
3. (Source Comment: According to this individual, Magariaf is allowing the current crisis in
the Abushagur administration to play out without direct interference. He is convinced that the desire
of the Libyan people for peace and stability, which brought him to power, added to the need to
balance the regional and political rivalries throughout the country, will lead to the formation of a
cabinet that is acceptable to all parties. Magariaf also believes that these developments will eventually
leave him as the dominant figure in the government.)
4. In addition, this individual added that Magariaf is seized with the national security
situation, the ongoing effort to disarm militia units, and the investigation of the murder of the United
States Ambassador. All of these efforts are related to what he sees as his most important role,
rebuilding the confidence of the international business community in its ability to operate in Libya
safely and efficiently. To this end he does agree with Abushagur that it is important to replace the
cabinet of former Prime Minister Abdel Rahman el-Keib, particularly Minister of Oil Abdulrahman
Ben Yazza, whose connections to the regime of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi, and the Italian
Oil firm ENI made him unacceptable to the JCP and other conservative parties. That said, this
individual notes that Magariaf was surprised and not pleased with the appointment to the ministry of
Mabrouk Issa Abu Harroura, another technical expert, who previously worked for Libya's Zueitina Oil

Company as well as in the oil sector abroad. Magariaf feels that Abu Harroura does not have the
standing among the foreign oil companies that Ben Yezza enjoyed, although he was more acceptable
to a number of the conservative members of the GNC.
5. Magariaf was pleased that the Prime Minister, after dramatic confrontations with MPs and
demonstrators who entered the GNC chamber, withdrew his cabinet nominations. The President
again advised Abushagur to name former Oil and Finance Minister Ali Tarhouni to the Oil Ministry
post; however, he fears that that Ali Tarhouni is seen as too close to Western governments to gain
acceptance in the GNC. Magariaf is concerned that, while the new cabinet Abushagur plans to put
forward on October 7 may contain some members of the NFA and other moderate groups, it will still
be dominated by the JCP and conservative elements, and will again fail to gain acceptance, leading to
a real government crisis.
6. According to this individual Magariaf and his advisors knew in advance that more than mo
protesters planned to enter the GNC session on October 4, in an effort to prevent MPs from convening
to vote on the new cabinet. While Magariaf did not directly influence these protesters he did nothing
to warn or advise Abushagur on the developing situation. In particular, the protestors objected to the
failure of the Prime Minister to name any minister from the Zawiya region. Although the
demonstrators eventually left the hall, a number of the independent MPs, who had said they would
support the new cabinet, were shaken by the incident and changed their positions. In the end,
according to this individual, Abushagur's efforts to rally their support failed, and he was forced to
withdraw all of the nominees, promising to submit a new list on October 7, one that would take into
account regional and political considerations.
7. In the opinion of a particularly sensitive source, the failure of Abushagur to name any NFA
ministers to the new cabinet will continue to complicate the matter. For his part Magariaf is
concerned over international perceptions regarding the nature of the new Libyan government. In this
regard, he fears that the Western press is too sharply focused on the fact that the NFA holds the
largest single bloc of votes in the GNC (38), missing the fact that the real power in the parliament lies
with the 120 independent deputies, who tend to be somewhat conservative on religious and social
matters, while focusing primarily on local political issues. Magariaf believes that the appointment of
Ali Tarhouni, or another liberal not associated with the NFA, would serve to reassure Western
business and government leaders while demonstrating political balance to the Libyan people.
Although he continues to make this point, the President has no indication that Abushagur will follow
his advice. He does expect Abushagur to again select a majority of cabinet ministers associated with
the MB and the JCP.

8. (Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, Magariaf will remain focused on the
security situation, particularly as he is having some success disarming the militias following the death
of the U.S. Ambassador. According to this individual, Magariaf believes he must end the power of the
regional militia forces before the Libyan economy can improve. The President knows that foreign
companies are the key to Libyan oil production, but he fears that they will not increase their
commitment to Libya until the government can insure the security of their personnel and facilities. In
a final note, this individual added that the Italian government is stepping up its activities in Libya,
and the President expects them to pressure to Al3ushagur appoint an individual like Ben Yezza to the
Oil Ministry, where he can favor ENI and other Italian firms.)

Subject: Saudi Grand Mufti calls attacks on foreign embassies un-islamic (Reuters)
RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Ara.bia's Grand Mufti, the highest religious authority in the birthplace of Islam, on
Saturday denounced attacks on diplomats and embassies as un-Islamic after deadly protests against a U.S.-made
film mocking Islam's founder.
Sheikh Abdulaziz bin Abdullah Al al-Sheikh also called on governments and international bodies to
criminalise insults against prophets and excoriated the film that has prompted a wave of fury across the Middle
East.
""It is forbidden to punish the innocent for the wicked crimes of the guilty, or to attack those who have been
granted protection of their lives and property, or to expose public buildings to fire or destruction,"" he said in a
speech carried by state news agency SPA.
Describing the release of the crudely made short film as ""miserable"" and ""criminal"", he added that attacks on
the innocent and diplomats ""are also a distortion of the Islamic religion and are not accepted by God"".
At least nine people were killed after noon prayers on Friday in demonstrations across the Middle East.

In a speech Monday, former Governor Mitt Romneywill criticize President Barack Obama's handling of the
Sept. 11, 2012, attack on the U.S. mission in Benghazi and say it was probably the work of al Qaeda, the same group
that brought down the World Trade Center and struck the Pentagon on Sept. 11, 2001.
""The attacks on America last month should not be seen as random acts. They are expressions of a larger struggle
that is playing out across the broader Middle East -- a region that is now in the midst of the most profound upheaval
in a century. And the fault lines of this struggle can be seen clearly in Benghazi itself,"" Romney will say in a foreign-
policy-focused address at the Virginia Military Institute, according to excerpts released by his campaign.
""The attack on our consulate in Benghazi on Sept. nth, 2012, was likely the work of the same forces that attacked
our homeland on Sept. uth, 2001. This latest assault cannot be blamed on a reprehensible video insulting Islam,
despite the administration's attempts to convince us of that for so long. No, as the administration has finally
conceded, these attacks were the deliberate work of terrorists who use violence to impose their dark ideology on

others, especially women and girls; who are fighting to control much of the Middle East today; and who seek to
wage perpetual war on the West?
Some in the U.S. intelligence community believe that the attack on the Benghazi consulate that killed Amb.
Chris Stevens and three other Americans was led by the Benghazi chapter of Ansar al-Sharia, an extremist group
thought to have ties to Al Qaecla in the Islamic Magreb (AQIM), al Qaeda's North Africa affiliate.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton suggested that groups with links to AQIM were responsible for the Beghazi
attack in remarks at a UN. meeting on Sept. 26, but Stale Department and White House spokepersons have
repeated again and again that the precise identity of the attackers remains unknown pending an FBI investigation.
Romney will invoke the original Oa attacks as part of his argument that Obama has failed to respond to the rapid
changes in the Middle East with a proactive and coherent strategy to preserve American power and influence in the
region.
""I know the president hopes for a safer, freer, and a more prosperous Middle East allied with the United States. I
share this hope. But hope is not a strategy,"" Romney will say. ""We cannot support our friends and defeat our
enemies in the Middle East when our words are not backed up by deeds, when our defense spending is being
arbitrarily and deeply cut, when we have no trade agenda to speak of, and the perception of our strategy is not one
of partnership, but of passivity.â€” It is time to change come in the Middle East.""
Romney will promise to increase and tighten sanctions against Iran, permanently base one aircraft carrier group
each in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Gulf, condition aid to Egypt, and ""recommit America to the goal of a
democratic, prosperous Palestinian state living side by side in peace and security with the Jewish state of Israel.""
On Syria, Romney will promise to identify opposition groups that share American values and make sure they get
weapons to defeat the Syrian regime's tanks, helicopters, and fighter jets. He won't say that the United States should
arm the rebels directly only that it should make sure they get advanced weaponry.
On Afghanistan, Romney will accuse Obama of timing the withdrawal of U.S. forces based on political
considerations, a reference to the fact that Â°halite withdrew all 30,000 ""surge"" forces last month. But Romney will
reiterate his call to complete the withdrawal of combat troops by the end of 2014, so long as the conditions on the
ground permit and in consultation with the military chain of command.
""I believe that if America does not lead, others will -- others who do not share our interests and our values -- and the
world will grow darker, for our friends and for us. America's security and the cause of freedom cannot afford four
more years like the last four years,"" Romney will say. 'The 21st century can and must be an American century. It
began with terror, war, and economic calamity. It is our duty to steer it onto the path of freedom, peace, and
prosperity.""
The Romney campaign held a conference call for reporters Sunday to preview the speech, which included
participation by campaign foreign-policy coordinator Alex Wongand senior advisors Rich Williamson and
Eliot Cohen.

Wong said that Mama has stepped away from American leadership and undermined the basis of American power.
He also said the standing of the United States has been weakened in every region of the world, and likened Obaina's
foreign policy to that of former President Jimmy Carter.
Williamson said that Mama has a policy of weakness that is provocative to enemies and that his administration
hasn't been transparent on the Benghazi attacks.
""The foreign policy of Barack Obama in the Middle East is a mess and is failing, and that should be a part of the
discussion,"" Williamson said
The Mama campaign preemptively released a statement calling Romney a neophyte and flip-flopper on foreign
policy who has fumbled his forays into foreign-policy issues throughout the campaign.
""If Mitt Romney wants to have a debate about foreign policy, we have a message for him: bring it on... To date, all
Mitt Romney has offered is bluster and platitudes. He's erratically shifted positions on every major foreign policy
issue, including intervening in Libya, which he was against before he was for,"" Obama for America spokeswoman
LizSmith said in the statement,
""'Mainstream' foreign policy isn't what Mitt Romneyis putting forward: having plans to start wars but not end
them; wanting to keep so,000 U.S. troops in Iraq indefinitely; exploding our defense spending to levels the
Pentagon has not asked for, with no way to pay for it; insulting our allies and partners around the world on the
campaign trail; and calling Russia our number-one geopolitical foe. If that's where Mitt Romney thinks the
mainstream is, he needs to find a better compass. It's clear that on every measure, Mitt Romney fails the
commander-in-chief test.""

Latest report:
LIBYA/GREAT BRITAIN/FRANCE
On the morning of April 8, an individual with direct access to the leadership of the Libyan National Council (LNC) stated in
strictest confidence that members of the Military Committee of the LNC are concerned that despite the involvement of
NATO against the forces of tkiluamrnar Qaddafi, the government of Great Britain is using its intelligence services in an
effort to dictate the actions of both the LNC and the Qaddafi regime. These individuals add that they have been informed
by contacts in France and Italy that while they have been engaged in discussions with the LNC regarding possible
assistance, British diplomats and intelligence officers have maintained contact with members of the Qaddafi government
in an effort to protect the British position in the event the rebellion settles into a stalemate. These LNC officials believe
that the defection of Libyan Minister of Foreign Affairs Mouse Kousa to the United Kingdom was part of this effort. By the
same token they believe that British intelligence officers are in discussion with associates of Saif akislarn Qaddafi,
regarding future relations between the two countries if he takes over power from his father and implements reforms.
According to these individuals, senior LNC military personnel suspect that despite early indications that they would
provide clandestine military support to the rebels; neither the French nor the British government will provide the rebels
with enough equipment and training to defeat Qaddafi's forces. They also believe that the French, British, and other
European countries will be satisfied with a stalemate that leaves Libya divided into two rival entities.
(Source Comment: In the opinion of these individuals the LNC military leaders are considering the possibility of hiring
private secunty firms to help train and organize their forces. One of these individuals added that a number of the LNC
members believe that this solution may be best for the rebels; noting that if they accept clandestine aid from France
and/or Great Britain those two countries will be in a position to control the development of post Qaddafi Libya.)
LIBYA - INSURGENT ACTIVITY
(This information is based on sensitive reporting from individuals with direct access to the leadership ofthe
LNC.)
1. With little hope of achieving a quick military victory, the LNC is deploying a three part strategy; leveraging tribal
relationships, oil production and diplomatic pressure to get the better of Qaddafi. A former spokesman for the Libyan
Human Rights League (LHRL) in Europe, Ali Zidane, is in talks with representatives of tribes in Sebha and Sine in an
effort to persuade them to rally to the revolution and the LNG before fighting actually reaches their regions. Zidane is a
candidate to be the Minister of the Interior in the new Libya."" Among his close associates is Mohamed Allagui, president
of the LHRL, who is interested in the justice portfolio in the future, transition government.

2.At the same time, All Tarhouni, the LNC's financial expert and possibly Finance Minister in post-Qaddafi Libya, is
struggling to get oil exports back on track in eastern Libya, with backing from the United States and Qatar. The LNC
believes that the U.S will focus on restarting operations at the oil terminal in Tobruk. and an American envoy is expected
in Benghazi in the near future to facilitate this process. For its part, Qatar is advancing cash to the LNC to stimulate the
shipment of oil from eastern Libya. Some commodity traders stepped in recently (under contract from Qatar) to deliver
refined oil products to the insurgents. VITOL and the Swiss firm GLENCORE are operating in the rebel zone, but denied
any involvement in this shipment.
Elsewhere, these sources add that Mahmud Shammarn is overseeing the information and communications campaign for
the rebels against Qaddafi. Considered one of the LNC most important leaders, Sharnmam brings to the insurgency the
expertise he acquired while working for Voice of America, Foreign Policy, Newsweek and Al Jazeera. Shammam lived in
the U.S. for more than twenty years, and he is believed to have excellent connections in the U.S. Government.
3. Islamist activity: Libya's Islamist activists have maintained a low profile since the start of the insurgency in late
February; fearing that their activities would give credence to Qaddafi's claims that the rebeis are terrorists. As the LNC is
taking shape, they are now working to make their voice heard, and influence events within the LNC. Ali Sallabi, Salem Al
Shiki and Mohamed Al Guirtili, leading Islamic figures who had taken refuge in London (and are close to the Moslem
Brotherhood), drafted a 'national pact"" which looks like a road map for organizing the role of the Islamist movement in the
transition to a post â€” Qaddafi Libya.
Sallabi and his two associates draw their inspiration from the ""February 17 Movement which helped spark the uprising by
commemorating the massacre of Islamist prisoners at the Abu Salim prison in 1996. Prior to the current rebellion,
Mustapha Abdel Jalil, the President of the LNC and former Minister of Justice called for the release of reformed Islamists.
At present, the Islamists are handicapped by the fact they supported Sail's reform projects before the recent crisis. Saif
played a crucial part in getting the Islamists to sever ties between the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group's and al Qa'ida in the
Islamic Maghreb (AQIM).
EGYPT AND LIBYA:
A source with excellent access to the highest levels of the SUPREME COUNCIL OF THE ARMED FORCES (SCAF)
states that the Egyptian Military has turned its full attention to the crisis in Libya. Traditionally, Egypt is a strong influence
in the eastern Libyan region of Cyreriaica and is now taking advantage of the current crisis to regain that position.
Regardless of whether Muammar Qaddafi remains in power or not, the political division of Libya will give Egypt the
opportunity to fill the void in the east. A senior diplomatic source reported that since the early days of the Libyan crisis, the
Egyptian government has been quietly supporting Libyan opposition forces through training, weaponry, food, and medical
supplies, while attempting to organize a political structure in the east. In addition, Egyptian Special Operations troops are
serving with rebel forces in the eastern part of Libya. Senior Egyptian military officers stated privately that these troops
are responsible for many of the rebel's combat successes.
The following factors are the focus of Egypt's plans for a post-Qaddafi regime:
-Avoiding a refugee crisis. In the event Qaddafi's forces invade the east, Egypt is the most logical destination for
refugees from Libyan. Egypt has an interest in controlling any turmoil in Libya that could harm efforts to restart its
struggling economy.
-Labor market. Libya is an important market for unemployed Egyptian laborers. According to the Egyptian Labor
Ministry, around 1.5 million Egyptians reside and work in Libya, sending home an estimated $254 million in remittances
In the past few years, Qaddafi has placed heavy restrictions on foreign workers, and Egypt hopes that a new regime will
be more flexible, and open to receiving Egyptian workers.
-Radical Islamists. Traditionally, the eastern part of Libya has been a stronghold for radical Islamist groups, including
the al Qaida-linked Libyan Islamic Fighting Group While Qaddafi's regime has been successful in suppressing the
jihadist threat in Libya, the current situation opens the door for jihadist resurgence. Egypt has a growing interest in
keeping a close eye on jrhadist movements in eastern Libya. This is especially true as the Egyptian Military is already
concerned about Islamist militancy overflow from Gaza, after their forces were pulled back to Cairo during the uprising
against Mubarak.
-Oil and energy resources. Egypt has strong economic interests in the oil rich eastern part of Libya. Any opportunity to
gain direct or indirect access to these energy resources will increase Egypt's wealth.

-Regional power. The Egypt's military-led government is looking to reestablish their country's role in the Arab world. So
far, Egypt has fostered discussions in the Palestinian territories between Fatah and Homes, while reaching out to Syria
and Saudi Arabia on the issue of Iran.
(Source Comment: According to a sensitive diplomatic source, the current Egyptian diplomatic strategy is to enhance its
stature by defending the Libyan people against Qaddafi's regime, while at the same time, distancing itself from any
military intervention led by the region's former colonial powers in Europe.)
It should be noted that, in the opinion of knowledgeable sources, Egypt cannot count on the support of every Arab power
in the region. Egypt led the call for imposing the no-fly zone in Libya, while Algeria, while Yemen, and Syria voted against
it. These countries (especially Yemen) fear the precedence that would be created for their own governments in the event
Qaddafi is ousted.
(Source Comment: A source with access to the leadership of NATO state in confidence that their information indicates
that Syria and Algeria are concerned with Egypt's revival in the region. This source stated that a de facto split between
eastern and western Libya would give Egypt the opportunity to reassume an influential position in Cyrenaica.)

Hillary,
I just want to offer my personal condolences over the loss of four fine foreign service officers. The Ambassador
was a perfect role model of the kind of person we need representing us around the world, and the others had so
much to give -- and already had given so much.
I know it has been a hard week for you, and I wanted simply to express my sympathy and tell you I was

participation by campaign foreign-policy coordinator Alex Wong and senior advisors Rich Williamson and
Eliot Cohen.
Wong said that Obama has stepped away from American leadership and undermined the basis of American power.
He also said the standing of the United States has been weakened in every region of the world, and likened Obama's
foreign policy to that of former President Jimmy Carter.
Williamson said that Obama has a policy of weakness that is provocative to enemies and that his administration
hasn't been transparent on the Benghazi attacks.
""The foreign policy of Barack Obama in the Middle East is a mess and is failing, and that should be a part of the
discussion,"" Williamson said.
The Obama campaign preemptively released a statement calling Romney a neophyte and flip-fiopper on foreign
policy who has fumbled his forays into foreign-policy issues throughout the campaign.
""If Mitt Romney wants to have a debate about foreign policy, we have a message for him: bring it on... To date, all
Mitt Romney has offered is bluster and platitudes. He's erratically shifted positions on every major foreign policy
issue, including intervening in Libya, which he was against before he was for,"" Obama for America spokeswoman
Liz Smith said in the statement.
""Mainstream' foreign policy isn't what Mitt Romney is putting forward: having plans to start wars but not end
them; wanting to keep 30,000 U.S. troops in Iraq indefinitely; exploding our defense spending to levels the
Pentagon has not asked for, with no way to pay for it; insulting our allies and partners around the world on the
campaign trail; and calling Russia our number-one geopolitical foe. If that's where Mitt Romney thinks the
mainstream is, he needs to find a better compass. It's clear that on every measure, Mitt Romney fails the
commander-in-chief test.""

VS intelligence warned embassy in Egypt of concern,
about anti-Nluslirn film
By Suzanne Kelly
Concerned about the reaction to an anti-Muslim film that was gaining attention online, the U.S. intelligence
community sent a cable to the embassy in Egypt warning of the concern, a U.S. official told CNN. It was sent
48 hours before the protests in Cairo and Benghazi in Libya, the official said
The cable did not discuss any specific threat, the official said. It warned instead about the existence of the
movie being posted on the hamlet and the fact that it was gaining attention. A seven minute portion of the
movie aired on an Egyptian TV talk show the weekend before the protests started, according to a Department of
Homeland Security/Federal Bureau of Intelligence memo obtained by CNN on Thursday.
The cable was not sent to the embassy in Tripoli, Libya or the consulate in Benghazi. US officials have said
there was no intelligence ahead of the attack in Benghazi, which intelligence officials still believe was not
planned. The White House spokesman Jay Carney said Friday there was no ""actionable intelligence"" indicating
an attack was being planned.
There are hundreds if not thousands of cables sent each day, the official said, and there was no specific threat
attached to this one, because a specific threat was not known

Issa targets Hillary: Big mistake
By Brent Budowsky - 10/10/12 04:03 PM ET
Don't miss the story in The Hill ""Issa closes in on Clinton"" about Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) aiming at his
biggest target yet, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The story is correct. The Issa strategy will backfire. It will
prove to be a disaster. House Republicans, whose brand is not exactly soaring with voters, are making a huge
mistake using congressional hearings as a partisan weapon to exploit a national tragedy to attack one of the
most admired and respected public servants in the nation.
There is now an independent and nonpartisan investigation of exactly what happened in Libya. A partisan
witch-hunt by Republicans using taxpayer money against Secretary Clinton, as a partisan weapon in the closing
days of an election, to exploit a tragedy to score political points is exactly what the American people believe
has gone wrong with Washington, and is exactly why the Republican brand is in such disrepute with many
voters.
Many independent voters will be offended. Many female voters will be offended. Many voters tired of their
taxpayer money being wasted for political shenanigans will be offended.

LIBYNGREAT BRITAIN/FRANCE
On the morning of April 8, an individual with direct access to the leadership of the Libyan National Council (LNC) stated in
strictest confidence that members of the Military Committee of the LNC are concerned that despite the involvement of
NATO against the forces of Muammar Qacidafi, the government of Great Britain is using its intelligence services in an
effort to dictate the actions of both the LNC and the Qaddafi regime. These individuals add that they have been informed
by contacts in France and Italy that while they have been engaged in discussions with the LNC regarding possible
assistance, British diplomats and intelligence officers have maintained contact with members of the Qadclafi government,
in an effort to protect the British position in the event the rebellion settles into a stalemate. These LNC officials believe
that the defection of Libyan Minister of Foreign Affairs Mouse Kousa to the United Kingdom was part of this effort By the
same token they believe that British intelligence officers are in discussion with associates of Safi al-Islam Qaddafi,
regarding future relations between the two countries if he takes over power from his father and implements reforms.
According to these individuals, senior LNC military personnel suspect that despite early indications that they would
provide clandestine military support to the rebels; neither the French nor the British government will provide the rebels
with enough equipment and training to defeat Qaddafi's forces. They also believe that the French. British, and other
European countries will be satisfied with a stalemate that leaves Libya divided into two rival entities.
(Source Comment: in the opinion of these individuals the LNC military leaders are considering the possibility of hiring
private security firms to help train and organize their forces_ One of these individuals added that a number of the LNC
members believe that this solution may be best for the rebels; noting that if they accept clandestine aid from France
and/or Great Britain those two countries will be in a position to control the development of post-Qaddafi Libya)

1.With little hope of achieving a quick military victory, the LNC is deploying a three part strategy; leveraging tribal
relationships, oil production and diplomatic pressure to get the better of Qaddafi. A former spokesman for the Libyan
Human Rights League (LHRL) in Europe, Ali Ziciane, is in talks with representatives of tribes in Sebha and Sirte in an
effort to persuade them to rally to the revolution and the LNC before fighting actually reaches their regions. Zidane is a
candidate to be the Minister of the Interior in the ""new Libya."" Among his close associates is Mohamed Allagui, president
of the LHRL, who is interested in the justice portfolio in the future, transition government
2. At the same time, All Tarhouni, the LNC's financial expert and possibly Finance Minister in post-Qaddafi Libya, is
struggling to get oil exports back on track in eastern Libya, with backing from the United States and Qatar. The LNC
believes that the U.S. will focus on restarting operations at the oil terminal in TGWU*, and an American envoy is expected
in Benghazi in the near future to facilitate this process. For its part, Qatar is advancing cash to the LNG to stimulate the
shipment of oil from eastern Libya. Some commodity traders stepped in recently (under contract from Qatar) to deliver
refined oil products to the insurgents. VITOL and the Swiss firm GLENCORE are operating in the rebel zone, but denied
any involvement in this shipment.
Elsewhere, these sources add that Materna:I Shannmarn is overseeing the information and communications campaign for
the rebels against Qaddafi. Considered one of the LNC most important leaders, Shammam brings to the insurgency the
expertise he acquired while working forVoice of America, Foreign Policy, Newsweek and Al Jazeera. Shammarri lived in
the U.S. for more than twenty years, and he is believed to have excellent connections in the U.S. Government.
3. Islamist activity: Libya's Islamist activists have maintained a low profile since the start of the insurgency in late
February; fearing that their activities would give credence to Qaddafi's claims that the rebels are terrorists. As the LNC is
taking shape, they are now working to make their voice heard, and influence events within the LNC, All Saliabi, Salem Al
Shiki and Mohamed Al Guirtili, leading Islamic figures who had taken refuge in London (and are close to the Moslem
Brotherhood), drafted a ""national pact"" which looks like a road map for organizing the role of the Islamist movement in the
transition to a post â€” Qaddafi Libya,
Sallabi and his two associates draw their inspiration from the ""February 17 Movement' which helped spark the uprising by
commemorating the massacre of Islamist prisoners at the Abu Salim prison in 1996. Prior to the current rebellion,
Mustapha Abdel Jail!, the President of the LNC and former Minister of Justice called for the release of reformed Islamists.
At present, the Islamists are handicapped by the fact they supported Saifs reform projects before the recent crisis. Saif
played a crucial part in getting the Islamists to sever ties between the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group's and al Qa'ida in the
Islamic Maghreb (AQIM).
EGYPT AND LIBYA:
A source with excellent access to the highest levels of the SUPREME COUNCIL OF THE ARMED FORCES (SCAF)
states that the Egyptian Military has turned its full attention to the crisis in Libya. Traditionally, Egypt is a strong influence
in the eastern Libyan region of Cyrenaica and is now taking advantage of the current crisis to regain that position.
Regardless of whether Muammar Qaddafi remains in power or not, the political division of Libya will give Egypt the
opportunity to fill the void in the east. A senior diplomatic source reported that since the early days of the Libyan crisis, the
Egyptian government has been quietly supporting Libyan opposition forces through training, weaponry, food, and medical
supplies, while attempting to organize a political structure in the east. In addition, Egyptian Special Operations troops are
serving with mitel forces in the eastern part of Libya. Senior Egyptian military officers stated privately that these troops
are responsible for many of the rebel's combat successes.
The following factors are the focus of Egypt's plans for a post-Qaddafi regime:
-Avoiding a refugee crisis. In the event Qaddaffs forces invade the east, Egypt is the most logical destination for
refugees from Libyan. Egypt has an interest in controlling any turmoil in Libya that could harm efforts to restart its
struggling economy.
-Labor market. Libya is an important market for unemployed Egyptian laborers. According to the Egyptian Labor
Ministry, around 1.5 million Egyptians reside and work in Libya, sending home an estimated $254 million in remittances.
In the past few years, Qaddafi has placed heavy restrictions on foreign workers, and Egypt hopes that a new regime will
be more flexible, and open to receiving Egyptian workers.
-Radical Islamists. Traditionally, the eastern part of Libya has been a stronghold for radical Islamist groups, including
the al Qaida-linked Libyan Islamic Fighting Group. While Qadclafi's regime has been successful in suppressing the
jihadist threat in Libya, the current situation opens the door for jihadist resurgence. Egypt has a growing interest in
keeping a close eye on jihadist movements in eastern Libya. This is especially true as the Egyptian Military is already

concerned about Islamist militancy overflow from Gaza, after their forces were pulled back to Cairo during the uprising
against Mubarak.
-Oil and energy resources. Egypt has strong economic interests in the oil rich eastern part of Libya. Any opportunity to
gain direct or indirect access to these energy resources will increase Egypt's wealth.
-Regional power. The Egypt's military-led government is looking to reestablish their country's role in the Arab world. So
far, Egypt has fostered discussions in the Palestinian territories between Fatah and 1-lamas, while reaching out to Syria
and Saudi Arabia on the issue of Iran.
(Source Comment According to a sensitive diplomatic source, the current Egyptian diplomatic strategy is to enhance its
stature by defending the Libyan people against Qaddafi's regime, while at the same time, distancing itself from any
military intervention led by the region's former colonial powers in Europe.)
It should be noted that, in the opinion of knowledgeable sources, Egypt cannot count on the support of every Arab power
in the region. Egypt led the call for imposing the no-fly zone in Libya, while Algeria, while Yemen, and Syria voted against
it. These countries (especially Yemen) fear the precedence that would be created for their own governments in the event
Qaddati is ousted.
(Source Comment: A source with access to the leadership of NATO state in confidence that their information indicates
that Syria and Algeria are concerned with Egypt's revival in the region. This source stated that a de facto split between
eastern and western Libya would give Egypt the opportunity to reassume an influential position in Cyrenaica.)

privately that these troops are responsible for many of the rebel's combat successes.
The following factors are the focus of Egypt's plans for a post-Qaddafi regime:
-Avoiding a refugee crisis. In the event Qaddafes forces invade the east, Egypt is the most
logical destination for refugees from Libyan. Egypt has an interest in controlling any turmoil in
Libya that could harm efforts to restart its struggling economy.
-Labor market. Libya is an important market for unemployed Egyptian laborers. According to
the Egyptian Labor Ministry, around 1.5 million Egyptians reside and work in Libya, sending
home an estimated $254 million in remittances. In the past few years, Qaddafi has placed heavy
restrictions on foreign workers, and Egypt hopes that a new regime will be more flexible, and
open to receiving Egyptian workers.
-Radical hlarnists. Traditionally, the eastern part of Libya has been a stronghold for radical
Islamist groups, including the al Qaida-linked Libyan Islamic Fighting Group. While Qaddafi 's
regime has been successful in suppressing the jihadist threat in Libya, the current situation opens
the door for jihadist resurgence. Egypt has a growing interest in keeping a close eye on jihadist
movements in eastern Libya. This is especially true as the Egyptian Military is already
concerned about Islamist militancy overflow from Gaza, after their forces were pulled back to
Cairo during the uprising against Mubarak.
-Oil and energy resources. Egypt has strong economic interests in the oil rich eastern part of
Libya. Any opportunity to gain direct or indirect access to these energy resources will increase
Egypt's wealth.
-Regional power. The Egypt's military-led government is looking to reestablish their country's
role in the Arab world. So far, Egypt has fostered discussions in the Palestinian territories
between Fatah and flamas, while reaching out to Syria and Saudi Arabia on the issue of Iran
(Source Comment: According to a sensitive diplomatic source, the current Egyptian diplomatic
strategy is to enhance its stature by defending the Libyan people against Qaddafi 's regime, while
at the same time, distancing itself from any military intervention led by the region's former
colonial powers in Europe.)
It should be noted that, in the opinion of knowledgeable sources, Egypt cannot count on the
support of every Arab. power in the region. Egypt led the call for imposing the no-fly zone in
Libya, while Algeria, while Yemen, and Syria voted against it These countries (especially

Subject: Stevens Update (important)
(SBU) Per Special Envoy Stevens:
â€¢ The situation in Ajdabiyah has worsened to the point where Stevens is considering departure from Benghazi. The
envoy's delegation is currently doing a phased checkout (paying the hotel bills, moving some comms to the boat,
etc). He will monitor the situation to see if it deteriorates further, but no decision has been made on departure. He will
wait 2-3 more hours, then revisit the decision on departure.
He received reports of shelling last night in Ajdabiyah as well as snipers shooting people in the city. AFRICOM
reported Qadhafi's forces took the eastern and western gates of Ajdabiyah, with 5 vehicles at the eastern gate and 50 at
the western gate. More Qadhafi forces are heading to Ajdabiyah from Brega.
The Brits report Qadhafi forces are moving from Sirte to Brega, which they interpret as preparation for another
assault on Ajdabiyah today.
He plans to discuss the situation further with the Brits, Turks, and the TNC to see if this is an irreversible
situation. Departure would send a significant political signal, and would be interpreted as the U.S. losing confidence in
the TNC. Initial message to the TNC would frame the departure as due to security grounds and as a temporary measure
only.
Polaschik said she would discuss these developments with Amb. Cretz.
If the group departs, the contract for the boat stipulates they return to Greece. One scenario could be the group
stages elsewhere for a few days.
Ops will continue to monitor the situation.

All:
Ops has provided below the latest Stevens update on Benghazi:
â€¢ Traffkaccidenti Police have accepted the USG version of the story: that it was an accident and the
victims were not wearing seathelts. The USG employees were returning from the airport when the
incident occurred. A total of four people died and six injured. USG employee Mjuries are light if any.
Our people are standing by pending official USG instructions. Stevens notes there is a UK flight
tomorrow they could be on if necessary. The TNC wants to do a press release to quell the rumor mill.
Stevens will send the draft back to Department for L and PA clearance.
â€¢ The British envoy departs tomorrow on permanent change of station. There will be a gap before his
replacement, John Jenkins, arrives from Baghdad.
â€¢ INC head Malunoud fibril will be going to Jordan and will not be back in Benghazi until Friday. The
development is likely to he met with additional criticism that he is spending too much time abroad at the
expense of other government affairs.

Benghazi Sitrep 017, April 22, 2011
Politicallecsmomic developments
Coda McCain: Senator McCain had an enthusiastic reception in Benghazi. The TNC welcomed his strong
statements of support, and US flag-waving Libyans cheered him wherever he went. The INC praised the
introduction of US Predator aircraft and asked that the US jam Libyan television broadcasting, The NC's
finance minister told him that his top ptiotities are to obtain a line of credit to meet basic needs, and to find a
way under the sanctions to allow trade with the liberated parts of Libya. He was impressed by the civilian
leadership but came away with serious doubts about the military's leadership, organization, and capabilities. He
was heartened to hear that the MC plans to shake up the military leadership and appoint a minister of defense--
equivalent as early as next week. In a press conference, he advocated the use of more effective US strike
aircraft in the NATO missions and US facilitation of 3""I party arms transfers to the rebels; be stopped short of
endorsing the introduction of US military advisers, saying that role could be filled by others. He was clearly
moved by the plight of the people of Misrata and visited a hospital where he met a number of patients who were
severely wounded in the fighting there. The Human Rights Watch representative in Benghazi and a INC
member from Misrata briefed him on the situation there.
Consular issue: Conoff received the deceased Amcies personal effects from the IOM representative in Benghazi
and submitted them to the UK delegation in Benghazi in order to be flown out with the body. The Aincifs body
departed Libya on the evening of 22 April.
Injured Arncit will board a UNICEF-chartered ship that will depart Misurata at 2300 local time on B6
22 April and will arrive in Malta approximately 22 hours later.
A memorial service for the journalists was held at the Tibesti hotel, attended by INC deputy chairman Abd al-
Hafidh Goglia, the UK envoy, and the US envoy. Ghoga and the envoys also delivered remarks.

Madam Secretary: I want to let you know about a temporary rotation in Benghazi. TNC Envoy Chris Stevens has been
on the road since March 13, when he began his outreach mission, and has been in Benghazi since April 5.
discussed this with Bill Bums today. Bill and I support this request and look forward to
the opportunity to discuss with Chris the way forward with the INC.
I know how important it is to have continual coverage (security conditions permitting) in Benghazi. I will send Embassy
Tripoli's DCM Joan Polaschik to serve as Acting Envoy during Chris' absence. Like Chris, she knows many of the TNC
leaders from her time in Tripoli. Since her return to Washington, she's been working with Gene and NEA on Libya
policy and also been coordinating many of the support issues for the team in Benghazi.
Cheers,

Thank you.
We are offering 7pm to Holder and waiting to hear if he would like to speak secure.
We likely won't hear from the King for several hours but will keep you posted as soon as we do.

Tom, she moved that yellow chair as close as it went. Knee to knee. Amazed she didn't try knee in between knee. And if
that wasn't enough, she leaned forward. More like a pivot, as far as her torso could fold forward to minimize the space
between their heads. Was like the dental hygienist rolling around the floor to get the best access to your mouth
depending on what tooth she was trying to get access to I've never seen a Westerner invade her space like that And
even the non Westerners I've seen do it based on cultural differences have been only briefly to greet, This went on like
that for 51 minutes - unacceptable in any culture. I don't even think you see that behavior among any type of mammal.
The touching the leg and repeatedly calling her 'Hillary' was just gravy.
But it was wonderful. One of the best interviews I've ever witnessed. Wish it were on live tv.

One of the best I've ever seen. But she was her usual wacky self and pulled one move that I can't even describe so I'll let

Enjoy!

UNEDITED - FOR INTERNAL USE
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Monica Langley of The Wall Street Journal
October 10, 2012
Department of State
QUESTION: Oh,so you've had a fun morning.
SECRETARY CLINTON: It's been a busy morning.
QUESTION: Yeah, yeah.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Yeah.
QUESTION: So what did you do besides Desmond Tutu? I saw that one â€” (laughter) â€” but I know there's been much more.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, we did a lot of internal meetings which are kind of in preparation for everything to come the last
three months. So talking about all of the issues. I had everybody do a â€”
QUESTION: I'm moving closer.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Sure. (Laughter.) Had everybody do memos about what they wanted to get one and what they needed
from me to gel done, so we've been kind of going through all of that, and â€”

QUESTION: To get done before you actually leave (inaudible)?
SECRETARY CLINTON: Before I actually leave. And also to set up for some post election memos for the President about not
only what we do here at State and â€”
QUESTION: Are we recording this for sure? You know it's working? Okay.
PARTICIPANT: For sure, yes.
SECRETARY CLINTON: â€” USA1D, but also for how it interacts with the rest of government, DOD, usTR, Cournant , HI-IS, you
name it. So there's a lot of that work going on. Obviously, we're working hard to be responsive to the Congress in their requests on
our terrible tragedy in Benghazi, and give them information, and try to run an effective, accurate, investigation so we can get to the
bottom of what happened. And then I did have this long, funny meeting with Desmond Tutu and about 10 other people about the
International Day of the Girl, first ever.
QUESTION: I thought that was great.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Isn't that terrific?
QUESTION: As a mother of an only daughter â€”
SECRETARY CLINTON: Me too, me too.
QUESTION: Like you, exactly.
SECRETARY CLINTON: And I --
QUESTION: And Barbara was one of my daughter and Langley Grace's (ph) teachers.
SECRETARY CLINTON: You're kidding.
QUESTION: Yeah, who is Chelsea's â€”
SECRETARY CLINTON: Yeah, yeah.
QUESTION: -- best friend's mother.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Nicole --
QUESTION: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
SECRETARY CLINTON: -- is Chelsea's, yes, best friend.
QUESTION: Yeah, so I found out about that long ago.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Oh, she's a wonderful teacher.
QUESTION: Yes, she is. She's one of my daughter's favorite.
SECRETARY CLINTON: The whole family is fabulous. In fact, Nicole and Chelsea have remained such good friends, they live in
the same building in New York, and they're just great friends,
QUESTION: Oh gosh, isn't that mat?
SECRETARY CLINTON: Yeah.
QUESTION: Okay. So let me tell you about this story. It started as a personality profile of you.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Okay.

QUESTION: Ordered at the highest level of The Wall Street Journal â€” (laughter) â€” believe it or not. And I do page one profiles, but
this came down as like, ""You are the star of the Obama Administration.""
SECRETARY CLINTON: Oh, my goodness.
QUESTION: So I said, ""Okay, fine."" I had fun covering you in your campaigns.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Yeah, yeah.
QUESTION: And so I would love to do it even though I know very little about foreign policy and State â€” (laughter). I thought,
okay, this will be good for â€” this will be a good personality profile. Well, it morphed into â€” now it's become the action profile.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Okay.
QUESTION: Because your life â€”
SECRETARY CLINTON: â€” is just constant action.
QUESTION: Totally. I mean, you just about killed me over the last (inaudible) â€” (laughter). I've got nothing. I've got nothing
except gained five pounds. Anyway, I don't know how you do it. So and then I thought, for a graphic for this story, all we need to
do is show the countries you visited, we can put that in one color on a map of the globe.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Yeah, yeah.
QUESTION: And then if we colored in every country you've talked to or person you've touched, you've been all over the â€” you've
talked to like almost every country.
SECRETARY CLINTON: I think that's probably right.
QUESTION: In the last five weeks.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Yes.
QUESTION: I mean, it's been unbelievable.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Yeah, it's been pretty jam-packed.
QUESTION: It is.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Starting with August, coming all the way to mid-October.
QUESTION: Exactly. So I thought this story was going to be kind of your easy glide-out. It's turned out to be much â€”
SECRETARY CLINTON: I don't think there is such a thing. I think in today's world, there is nothing easy or potentially gliding for
this job. There is just too much going on, and you know everything that's going on because we are hyper-connected. So there's no
doubt in my mind I will work to the last minute before I leave the building.
QUESTION: Has this, though â€” since I'm focused on this last 4-5 week period â€” has it been your most challenging part of your
tenure, or not?
SECRETARY CLINTON: It's been among the most challenging. There's no doubt about that. And it's been challenging on many
levels. Of course, the terrible events in Benghazi, but also in other parts of the Middle East and North Africa that didn't get as much
attention because, thankfully, no one was killed or injured. But we've had to keep a close watch on a lot of different places. We've
spent â€” I've spent time, as you know, in the Far East, in China and Vladivostok, and working on trying to manage what are always
complicated relationships, but made more so because of changes in leadership and challenges like who owns what rock where,
QUESTION: Yeah, yeah.
SECRETARY CLINTON; And working hard with the ASEAN nations to support their efforts for peaceful resolution of their
disputes. UNGA is always exhausting. It is a non-stop dawn-to-midnight marathon.
QUESTION: Can I back you up to â€”

SECRETARY CLINTON: Sure.
QUESTION: Because I've joined you in Jakarta and Beijing.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Right.
QUESTION: That's all I could handle of your trip. (Laughter.) So in Jakarta, I watched you talk to the embassy folks there and
noticed one person said to you, ""I can't wait to vote for you in four years.""
SECRETARY CLINTON: Oh,
QUESTION: You said, ""Bless your heart,"" or something like that. (Laughter.) Okay, so â€” but I want to lay to get â€” I want to put â€”
string together these anecdotes.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Okay.
QUESTION: So I want to get your perspective on some of the things I saw. Now, in Beijing, a similar thing came up. I heard, at the
dinner â€” that dinner 'tit I a.m. So â€” did the Foreign Minister say to you â€” somebody told me he said to you, ""You will be so young
when you are President."" Do you remember his saying that?
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, it wasn't the Foreign Minister.
QUESTION: Oh, who said it?
SECRETARY CLINTON: It was the State Counselor --
QUESTION: Okay.
SECRETARY CLINTON: -- Dai Bingguo, who has become a very good partner for me as I've worked with China. He was my
counterpart in the Strategic and Economic Dialogue, and he was kidding me because he's retiring.
QUESTION: Are you sure he was kidding you?
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, I think so. That's my interpretation. He's retiring and he's probably at least ten years older than I
am. And he's saying to me, ""Why are you retiring? You're so young!"" [said, ""Boy, I'd travel a thousand miles to anywhere to be
told I was so young."" (Laughter.)
QUESTION: Okay.
SECRETARY CLINTON!: But it was more along the lines of, he will be leaving with the change in leadership in China, and I will
be voluntarily leaving, as I announced a year ago.
QUESTION: Yeah, yeah, yeah, more on that later.
Okay, so then, the next day, you have Xi cancel on you.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Yeah. I'm not --
QUESTION: Now, he cancelled on others, too.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Right.
QUESTION: But you were told â€” were you told it was the back injury?
SECRETARY CLINTON: Yeah. But that â€” we were told the night before, and I took it at face value, really, because from our
perspective, I had a very good set of discussions with him both here in Washington and in my previous trip to Beijing. And as you
know, he was unable to keep his schedule for ten days.
QUESTION: Right, he'd not been seen in public, exactly.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Yeah, so I didn't really think anything other than what I was told.

QUESTION: Did it frustrate you, though? 'Cause you were all the way over there, and --
SECRETARY CLINTON: No, because I had so many other meetings.
QUESTION: Okay. Okay, okay.
SECRETARY CLINTON: I mean, I didn't go specifically to see him. I went to continue our dialogue.
QUESTION: Did they get a little ticked off that we reported that it was a back injury, since they like to keep things so close to the
vest?
SECRETARY CLINTON: I don't â€” I don't know that.
QUESTION: Okay. And then at your press conference, I sat in the front row right in front of you because I was a pool reporter.
PARTICIPANT: Just like this. (Laughter.)
QUESTION: Yes, you know me. I like to be very touchy-feely. If I could've touched you, I would.
Anyway, so I sat there, and you as a politician came through to me loud and clear. You took control of that press conference, okay. I
mean, you said your little pleasantries, he said his pleasantries, and then you took charge. And it wasn't just about the South China
Seas. You hit all the things, Syria, Iran, not â€” and all the others. North Korea.
So then he was on his heels. And he's like â€” he was wanting to get in. So tell me: What was your thinking? Was it purposeful? Was
that your strategy going in? I'd like to â€” I want to describe that, because to me, you clearly had the political savvy over your
counterpart.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, we have very different systems. He's an incredibly accomplished diplomat, and as you rightly
point out, we both made our points. And I --
QUESTION: He did make his points, but only after he was on his heels.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, that's your interpretation.
QUESTION: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SECRETARY CLINTON: I had a very clear understanding of what I needed to say because there were all these issues that we were
talking about. And they are complicated, challenging issues. So I wanted to be sure that I put it out there, and I didn't want to say
anything other than what my assessment was at the time. Some people say, ""Well, you're in a foreign country, you shouldn't do this,""
or whatever.
QUESTION: Yeah, exactly.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Now, I mean, I think we're living in a world where everybody knows what you say everywhere.
QUESTION: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SECRETARY CLINTON: And I believe you have to say the same thing, you have to be consistent, repetitive, make the case
knowing full well that there's a resistance on the part of China and Russia to be more constructive in the Security Council. But insofar
as I could break through in their mass media as well as the international mass media, I was going to make that effort.
QUESTION: Which goes to this point which I was going to get to a little bit later about â€” one way you've tried to change, I think,
the Secretary of State â€” you've changed the terms of what it means, is this public diplomacy. You are knowing you're reaching a
different audience. You're not just playing right there at that press conference.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Right. A hundred percent right, Monica. I mean, I believe I am the chief public diplomat of the State
Department, and as well as the chief diplomat. But there's the public role to it, which is increasingly important, because you can't just
go somewhere, have your meeting behind closed doors, do a controlled readout, and go on to the next capital. Because in every
society now, you have to recognize there is a public audience as well as an official audience.

So I am conscious of that from the very first trip I made in early February 2009. I've been trying to talk about America's values and
our interests and our security everywhere I can.
QUESTION: Is that in pant â€” did you have a vision that you also have to remake America's brand?
SECRETARY CLINTON: I think we â€” I think our brand was battered for a lot of reasons. We came into office in the midst of the
economic crisis, which was very dangerous, and I thought that â€” and still do that confidence is a commodity, and we had to show
confidence. We had to be making smart decisions. We had to reassure leaders and markets and people, and that was part of my job
on that first trip that / made and every trip since.
I was in Hong Kong when the debate over the debt was going on, and I had all of these very wealthy, distinguished, high-ranking
people from Hong Kong lining up to say, ""What's going to happen in America? What are they doing over there?"" And I said, ""Oh,
don't worry about it. We will get to a decision."" Because! had to be, at that moment, displaying the kind of confidence that our
country has, and our ability to make decisions, even hard decisions, in order to keep leading the world economically and politically,
and I believe that,
QUESTION: Okay. Let me then jump â€” you came â€” well, of course, there's the campaign. On September 6th, you watch your
husband at the convention.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Right.
QUESTION: Okay. What did you feel at that moment?
SECRETARY CLINTON: Oh, I was thrilled. It was so odd for me not to be there. I've been at every convention for decades, and
there I was in East â€”
QUESTION: Did you miss it?
SECRETARY CLINTON: â€” in Timor-Lege.
QUESTION: Yeah. Yeah.
SECRETARY CLINTON: I missed a lot of what goes with conventions seeing people from all over the country, having that sense
of purpose that a convention is supposed to give you to go out in the election and work your heart out for your candidate. But on the
other hand, I also believed and knew that what I was doing was very important for my country, So I certainly didn't miss
QUESTION: And did you hear you were a big topic of conversation there about whether Hillary â€”
SECRETARY CLINTON: Yes, well â€”
QUESTION: --2016?
SECRETARY CLINTON: That seems to be a topic of conversation for a lot of people, which is â€”
QUESTION: Everywhere, okay.
SECRETARY CLINTON: -- which is fine.
QUESTION: Okay.
SECRETARY CLINTON: But it was thanks to the hard work of Philippe and others that we were able to see in nearly real time. I
mean, we had to wait till it was recorded, because I had a schedule that I had to keep, but then we were able to watch the whole
speech. It was great.
QUESTION: Yeah, Okay. Now, you came back home September 1 Ph. So let's talk about how you faced that day, just a couple key
moments, because I don't want to relive the whole thing.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Right.
QUESTION: But what were the key moments to you? Was it when you first were told the Ambassador's missing? Was it when you
found out he was actually â€” they had found him?

SECRETARY CLINTON: No. It predated that, because I take September 116' very seriously. I was a senator from New York on
September I 1th.
QUESTION: Right. And I lived in New York on September 1 Ph at the time.
SECRETARY CLINTON: And it was a searing, painful experience in every way, and so every September I I'm on hyper alert
for what's going on around the world. And we always have discussions in our security â€” among our security experts okay,
September I le is coming up. Because we pick up intelligence, we pick up chatter that people might want to do something somewhere
in the world. So everybody is watching. That's but we had a very strong set of standards that we've tried to follow around the
world.
And then simultaneously, we had this video coming out, which we were getting lots of feedback from our posts that this was a
problem, that people were reacting to it So there was a lot swirling around. And clearly, when we started hearing about what was
happening in Cairn, what was happening in Tunisia, what as happening in Benghazi and other places â€” because there were
demonstrations going on in many places and they were being to some extent, hijacked by extremists with other agendas.
But then when we were alerted to what was going on in Benghazi, we were all just totally focused on trying to find out what we could
under quite difficult circumstances, and we're still trying to get to the bottom of what happened when. But that day, it was all
consuming. We were all just as active as we could given the distance, trying to manage everything that was happening, and be
responsive in real time. And of course, it was primarily the duty of the security experts who have those responsibilities, but I was here
and others were here trying to sort through all the information as it was coming in.
QUESTION: Do you â€” today the front page of the Post says this is now going to mar your â€” what had been your great record at
State. I mean, are you ultimately, Hillary, going to have to take responsibility for this'?
SECRETARY CLINTON: Oh, I take responsibility. That's not even â€” that's not a question. I take responsibility. I'm the
Secretary of State. I have 60,000-plus employees around the world, and this is like a big family. I mean, these Foreign Service and
Civil Service officers, many of whom have worked with each other, they know each other, I have â€” I'm working with people today
that I first met when I was First Lady, and they were a young diplomat somewhere that I showed up. I sent Chris Stevens to Benghazi
in the height of the Libyan conflict.
QUESTION: Yeah, yeah.
SECRETARY CLINTON: And he was eager to go, and he was very effective, and then I recommended him to be our ambassador,
and I had the highest regard for him.
QUESTION: Gosh, that must make it that much â€”
SECRETARY CLINTON: Oh, it's painful, Monica. It's absolutely painful, because it's not Â°tat a faceless person.
QUESTION: Yeah, exactly.
SECRETARY CLINTON: It's people who, if I didn't know them personally, somebody close to me in this building knew them, had
worked with them, was at the same post five or ten years ago. So there's an extraordinary sense of loss and responsibility. Every one
of us who had any responsibility, from the security experts on up, we all feel like we have to figure out what happened, because we
clearly want to make sure it doesn't happen again. But there is an inherent risk in this job.
When I okayed sending Robert Ford to Hama at the beginning of the Syrian conflict, that was a risk. We said. ""Robert, do you want
to go there'? It's dangerous. We can't guarantee your safety, because we have to rely on host nations.""
QUESTION: Yeah, yeah.
SECRETARY CLINTON: But you think it's the right thing to do. It clearly sends a message about where the United States' values
are.
Or when I was in Egypt, and we were protested against in Cairo, and then the security people came to me and said, ""You're supposed
to go to Alexandria. It's a much less fortified position than we have in Cairo. Maybe you shouldn't go."" I said, 'No.'"" I said ""I'm
going to go."" I went. But I mean, we had people throwing shoes and tomatoes,
This is an inherently risky world. It is a dangerous world. And we will do our very best, as our military and intelligence colleagues
do, to try to think through how to provide as much security as possible, but you can't keep people behind 20-foot walls and expect

need to realize that it's not only our soldiers; it's our civilians serving our country who are also putting their lives on the line to â€”
QUESTION: Well, that's been the wakeup call of this incident.
SECRETARY CLINTON: -- to do the job that we ask them to do.
QUESTION: So one thing that a lot of people have said in this is another â€” somebody from the White House told me they thought
watching you and Â°barna at the Andrews Air Force Base, there was a new bond between you two, that everybody knows you all
aren't buddy-buddy, but you all clearly respect each other and work together. Do you feel that you had a new bond? I mean, I saw
that you touched his hand on watching theâ€” watching it, you touched his hand after he spoke, and then when you all walked back to
the families that he put his arm around your waist. Do you feel this gave some â€” did you feel that at that moment? Somebody at the
White House saw it, and then somebody at the State Department also thought so.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, I feel like there have been a number of moments â€” maybe not public moments â€”that have been
very, very precious to me in my relationship with the President I was in that very small group that made the decision about bin Ladin
and was there in that Sit Room, and --
QUESTION: Right, which we've all seen that picture.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Yes, going up and down the emotional rollercoaster. And walked with him across the Colonnade in the
White House for him to address the nation. I mean, there are a lot of moments, but that was a particularly poignant time for both of us
because we live every day â€” he as President, I as Secretary â€” with the knowledge that decisions we make, sending a Chris Stevens to
Libya, are ones that have risk and danger attached to them. And so I â€”
QUESTION: When he came here that â€”
SECRETARY CLINTON: Yes.
QUESTION: next day, did you call him and say, ""I'd love you to come over?""
SECRETARY CLINTON: I did. I did.
QUESTION: Do you call him, like, on the secure phone?
SECRETARY CLINTON: Oh, yes.
QUESTION: Where's the secure phone?
SECRETARY CLINTON: In my office.
QUESTION: Oh.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Yeah, yeah, we have a secure phone. Yeah.
QUESTION: I know. Did you call him on the secure phone?
SECRETARY CLINTON: We wanted --
QUESTION: Or do you only do that if there's, like, a real emergency?
SECRETARY CLINTON: Yeah. We communicate in lots of different ways. But I thought it was important if he could, but it was
â€” I knew that he has a lot of other demands on his thne, and I was going over to the Rose Garden and then I said, ""Mr. President, can â€”
do you have time to come by and see our people if we can get them gathered?"" And he didn't hesitate, absolutely. And it was --
QUESTION: Do you say Mr. President or do you say Barad?
SECRETARY CLINTON: I do. I say Mr. President. I believe strongly in saying Mr. President.
QUESTION: Okay.
SECRETARY CLINTON: I think it's a sign of respect for the person and for the office.

QUESTION: Okay.
SECRETARY CLINTON: I mean, I called him Barack when I was a senator with him, but --
QUESTION: Yeah, yeah.
SECRETARY CLINTON: -- now he's the President and [respect that.
QUESTION: Okay. Now let's start going toward UNGA. The â€” on September 15', I think the Saturday before Netanyahu was
going to be on Meet The Press, you had a private call with him.
SECRETARY CLINTON: I did, I did.
QUESTION: Okay. And that â€” the Mideast thing and Iran, it's kind of been in tumult. So the relationship â€” do you feel that you
need to work your â€” work on that with your past relationship with him? I mean, this is â€” as two politicians to one another, what's â€”
show me how this works.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, look. I've known Bibi a long time, and I consider him a friend. He is somebody who I've spent a
lot of time talking to in New York, in Washington, in Jerusalem. We have had long in-person conversations, long telephone
conversations. And I respect the fact that he is trying to protect Israel, that â€” I often tell people, put yourself into the position of the
Prime Minister of Israel at a time of great tumult and uncertainty. And so I guess I would say, on a pretty regular basis, we â€” I check
in with him.
QUESTION: Does that help, though, given that, kind of, people view his relationship with the President as rocky, that you all --
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well --
QUESTION: -- are in kind ofâ€” have your own relationship?
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, here's â€” I think he's been around so long he has good relationships with a lot of people, and I think
he has a relationship of mutual respect with the President. And his concerns about what's going to happen are totally
legitimate. They're concerns that the President shares, which is why the President has said our policy is prevention, not
containment. And he's been very, very clear about that.
QUESTION: Okay. Now then you go to New York for UNGA. But I talked to Betsy, your friend from Park Ridge.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Right, right.
QUESTION: Okay. So she brought this up on her own about your hair.
SECRETARY CLINTON: (Laughter.)
QUESTION: She said --
STAFF: I'm amazed you got â€” what --
QUESTION: (Laughter.) The pizza party --
SECRETARY CLINTON: Oh, right.
QUESTION: At the pizza party --
SECRETARY CLINTON: Right, right.
QUESTION: -- she said to you she likes your hair long, and she said it suits where you are in your life right now. Do you remember
her saying this to you?
SECRETARY CLINTON: Honestly, I don't, but --
QUESTION: Okay. I don't even bring this up.

STAFF: I can't believe you're using poor Betsy as a device.
QUESTION: know. This is great.
SECRETARY CLINTON: I would be happy to talk to you sometime about all ofâ€” all that, all that stuff.
QUESTION: Yeah, yeah, but not that. But she said that. Okay. All right.
SECRETARY CLINTON: (Laughter.)
QUESTION: So anyway, so you have the pizza party, then â€” and your husband and your daughter are there.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Right.
QUESTION: At least that was a nice break.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Right, right.
QUESTION: Okay. Then you go into full-scale work.
SECRETARY CLINTON: UNGA, UNGA, UNGA.
QUESTION: Okay. But you first appeared at the Clinton Global Initiative, which was a key â€”
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, no. I started working on Sunday.
QUESTION: Oh, okay, okay.
SECRETARY CLINTON: I was at the Clinton Global initiative Monday morning, but I started having what we call bilats on
Sunday.
QUESTION: Okay. Yeah. And I wrote down you did â€” it looks like you had 29 bilats, you had 54 meetings or events that
week. And I don't know if you noticed, but I was running in as a little pool reporter just to see any glimpse of you
SECRETARY CLINTON: (Laughter.)
QUESTION: And I would try to hang to hear what they were saying The Yemen President said you work nonstop, you're shuttling
around the world, you're on TV every day.
SECRETARY CLINTON: (Laughter.) Yeah.
QUESTION: I mean, your public image is really fascinating --
SECRETARY CLINTON: For people all over the world.
QUESTION: to all these foreign leaders.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Yeah, I know.
QUESTION: I mean, they really, like, admire that.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well --
QUESTION: Don't you think â€” what does that tell you?
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, look. I think in today's world, America has to show up. We have to show up in a lot of places to
make the case for what we believe are the right choices for us and for partners and the world. So I'm constantly being told by leaders,
presidents, prime ministers, foreign ministers, ""I'm exhausted watching you.""

QUESTION: Exactly. I once heard â€” they'll say that.
SECRETARY CLINTON: They're the very same people who get quite unhappy if! don't show up.
QUESTION: Exactly.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Like, Oh, can you come to this?"" ""Gee, I'm so sorry I can't."" ""Okay, I'll change the date. When can
you come?' So â€” and I know that it might not have been quite as important in times past, but now, because you're covered on
broadcast television, you're covered on the interne, people know you're there and you're making a case. And you're respecting
another country and another country's leaders enough to be in their palace, in their office, in their parliament.
And I have found that it eases the way for building interpersonal relations, which at the end of the day are at the root of much of what
we do in foreign relations. Doesn't mean that people are going to give up their self-interest or change their human nature. That's not
going to happen. But that there may be an opening that you can take advantage of to make a case that might otherwise not have been
heard if you were just barking orders at them from a thousand miles away.
QUESTION: Yeah. I know. You know what? I'm all about relationships, not transactions, and I see that in you --
SECRETARY CLINTON: Yeah.
QUESTION: -- in how you do your job.
SECRETARY CLINTON; It really matters. It matters. It's always mattered.
QUESTION: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SECRETARY CLINTON: But it especially matters in the world today.
QUESTION: I see that loud and clear. Okay. And then in the week of October, I noticed on your schedule â€” well, is there anything
about the UN, was there any key â€” you also met with people that are higher than you --
SECRETARY CLINTON: Yes, right.
QUESTION: -- because Marna left all that to you. Was there any key meeting that! should focus on?
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, I mean, gosh, there were so many. I mean --
QUESTION: I mean, the bulk of it was unbelievable, but was there one moment that was the one I should pick out --
SECRETARY CLINTON: Oh, I don't --
QUESTION: -- that was particularly sensitive or --
SECRETARY CLINTON: Let me think about that, Monica.
QUESTION: Okay.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Because, I mean, we had very intense conversations with the presidents of Afghanistan and Pakistan and
Egypt and --
QUESTION: Yeah.
SECRETARY CLINTON: -- Yemen and Libya and â€” (laughter) â€”
QUESTION: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.
SECRETARY CLINTON: I mean, it was a --
QUESTION: Well, maybe you could tell Philippe --

QUESTION: -- what would be the best one to single out from that time period.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Okay. We'll go through â€” yeah.
QUESTION: I mean, the bulk of it and then --
STAFF: Well rank all 24.
QUESTION: (Laughter.) And then on October I', that week, you led the U.S.-Afghanistan Bilateral Commission.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Right, right.
QUESTION: Is that important?
SECRETARY CLINTON: It's very important.
QUESTION: Okay.
SECRETARY CLINTON: It's part ofâ€” we negotiated something called a Strategic Partnership Agreement with Afghanistan as a
way of both committing ourselves to an enduring partnership with the Afghans, having an agenda that we would both follow so that
there wouldn't be second-guessing and finger pointing We would say, ""Look, here's what we want to work on together, and here's
how we have to proceed."" And this was the first of those meetings. And I found it to be much desired on the Afghan side, and on
ours as well because we wanted to clarify what we were going to be focusing on together.
QUESTION: Even after the â€” what's been happening with the suicide --
SECRETARY CLINTON: Yeah, right.
QUESTION: -- acts and all that? Okay.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Right, right, right.
QUESTION: Okay. Okay. Now, what do you want to be your legacy?
SECRETARY CLINTON: Oh, gosh. I have not stopped to think about that.
QUESTION:, Really?
SECRETARY CLINTON: Again, I will stop to think about it maybe in three months.
QUESTION: Okay.
SECRETARY CLINTON: I'm so in the moment. People say to me, ""What are you going to do next? Looking back, what's your
legacy?""
QUESTION: Yeah, that's coming to â€” yeah, yeah, yeah.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Honestly, I can't answer those questions because I just haven't allowed myself to stop and think them
through. And I don't want to divert my mind from what's going on right now There's too much going on right now that I have to be
focused on, so I'll let the rest work itself out.
QUESTION: Do you think, given the way the world is right now and how tough this last few weeks has been, have you even given a
thought to maybe staying as Secretary of State?
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, a lot of people have talked to me about that, but I --
QUESTION: But has the President?
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, I'm not going to go into any conversations with anybody, but I would be unlikely to do that. I
really made up my mind â€” now, at least a year or so ago â€” and I want to follow through on that. Because I think it's important for me

to just step off the incredibly high wire that I've been on for the last four years â€” actually for the last 20 years â€”just to take stock of the
rest of my life which is before me.
QUESTION: Yeah. And do you â€” I know you haven't given a lot of thought, but is there something that you just can't wait to do?
SECRETARY CLINTON: Oh, yeah, sleep. Sleep would be good.
QUESTION: How do you balance all this? I mean, you do go nonstop.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Yes, I do.
QUESTION: I mean, I've gained five pounds just travelling with you. (Laughter.) No joke. On that travel, it was an excuse to eat
shit. (Laughter.)
SECRETARY CLINTON: Yeah, there's a lot of it around. (Laughter.)
QUESTION: Yeah. I mean, you just grab food. They're like, oh, well I need this to get through the day. And I wasn't even
performing like you are; I just sit here and do nothing. So I blame you for this. So how do you do it?
SECRETARY CLINTON: I take responsibility for that too. (Laughter.)
QUESTION: Yeah, yeah, exactly. (Laughter.) How do you, like, balance --
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, first --
QUESTION: -- this physically and also to be, like, a strong leader but also then have the compassion and the person? I mean, how
do you pull it off?
SECRETARY CLINTON: Yeah. Well, I mean, first, it's just who I am. And I don't think about it being anything other than going
about my business. But look, I do try to exercise, I do try to eat right. I fall off the wagon on both. I do try to get enough sleep.
QUESTION: Yeah.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Not easy to do. Try to catch up it with whenever I can. But the work is so consuming, intellectually
demanding, with such high stakes â€” literally life and death at stake â€”
QUESTION: Yeah.
SECRETARY CLINTON: -- that I am constantly thinking and planning and reacting, trying to manage this extraordinary panoply
of issues around the world that I think are going to affect my country, my daughter, the future that I would like to see, and so it gets
me up every day and keeps me going till late at night.
QUESTION: And do you â€” your colleagues here tell me â€” you've got a great team, by the way â€” I have so much fun with them --
SECRETARY CLINTON: Thank you.
QUESTION: -- and they're all very talented.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Thank you.
QUESTION: But do you â€” they all tell me how you're always searching for the next best organizer.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Yes.
QUESTION: Saying you're always looking for the next best binder or â€” so what is this about you that you --
SECRETARY CLINTON: (Laughter.) It's almost a game that I play with myself. When you have as much coming at you as I do
every day, it's kind of a constant joke we have. Okay, our cards or paper or our boxes or some other form of storage â€” I mean, it's just
a way of kind of keeping it light, because there's so much serious that we have to do all the time.
QUESTION: And do you â€” is it true that the President gave you, like, an inscribed iPad cover or something?

SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, he gave me a great iPad cover that has my initials on it, which was really very welcome because
it's hard, so when you travel as much, it doesn't get knocked around.
QUESTION: Was it for a particular occasion? Or did you see one that he had or what?
SECRETARY CLINTON: We were just talking one day. We do that. I mean, I gave -
QUESTION: I know you're going to see him after me.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Very - yeah, very shortly, yeah.
QUESTION; I'll be happy to go with you, (Laughter)
SECRETARY CLINTON: Oh, I know I gave him an espresso machine one time We were talking about good espresso and how
hard it was to find. And I really enjoy mytime with him, and I also know probably better than anybody because of what - the
positions that I've had, and the respect I have for how hard - how impossible the job has always been, but certainly is today. It's not
all bad news. I mean, there's a lot of bad news I have to deliver, a lot of difficult issues I have to raise, a lot of hard questions be has
to grapple with So it's nice every so often to - like when Be the dog came in to see Aung San Sua Kyi, when I went to see -
QUESTION: Oh, well, I wanted to ask about that --
SECRETARY CLINTON: Oh, when I went to see her in Burma, I brought her gifts, which you do when you travel through
protocol. But I brought a gift for her dog she adores her dog - and the dog was such good company when she was under house
west. And so when she went to the White House to see the President, she really wanted to meet Bo the dog who she had heard about,
and the President was so great.
QUESTION: Oh, that's cool.
SECRETARY CLINTON; He had Be outside the Oval Office and when the meeting ended he said, ""Oh, wait, one more person I
want you to meet""' right? And in came Bothe dog She was so thrilled. I mean, we try to make it not just a grind because it could be
with everything going on in the world, literally just debilitating- trying to figure out the right thing to do how best to protect
America, how to get our values across, how to deal with intractable situations like the ones we face in so many places, So every so
often, we kind of lighten it up.
QUESTION: Which I forgot to mention in my little timetable of the action profile about you - you did see her when she was here
and you said you know something about being kind of an icon and becoming a politician, what that entails.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Yes, yes, yes, yes.
QUESTION: And you had her to your home for a dinner.
SECRETARY CLINTON: I did. I did.
QUESTION: And can you tell me a little about that and what that meant to you?
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, I -
QUESTION: Had she been to your home before?
SECRETARY CLINTON; No, no.
QUESTION: Okay.
SECRETARY CLINTON; She hadn't been in the United States in, I think, 40 years.
QUESTION: Oh, wow.
SECRETARY CLINTON: We can check that, but I think it's like 40 years. She had me in her home, and it was such an emotional
experience, and obviously I wanted to reciprocate. And so I had her in my home and we had a very small dinner. And before the
dinner, I spent about an hour with her just talking like two old friends, because I had felt when I met her for the first time that we'd
been friends forever. And I just so highly admire her but I also have such affection for her

QUESTION: Now you did talk about what it's like to be a politician and things like that --
SECRETARY CLINTON: Right, right, right
QUESTION: -- and get into the nitty-gritty. Now your approval rating right now is close to 70 percent. So a lot of people are asking
the obvious question: What about 2016? And people â€” do you think now people --
STAFF: I thought the obvious question was: Who are the other 30? (Laughter.)
QUESTION: Well, yeah. What happened with the other 30? How are they not approving? (Laughter.) So do you â€” I mean, do you
think that â€” why do you think people see you now differently than when you were running for office, or --
SECRETARY CLINTON: I can't even speculate on that, Monica, because I feel like I've always been the same, other than perhaps
my hairstyles, which have changed over the last 65 years.
QUESTION: (Laughter.) Haven't we all, though? Yeah, even men's.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Yes, indeed.
QUESTION: It's not just women.
SECRETARY CLINTON: But I feel like I've been the same person but in different roles over time. And I appreciate the fact that
people are favorably inclined and supporting what I'm trying to do as Secretary, but I can't really venture a theory as to why or why
not. I just have to get up every day and do the best I can.
QUESTION: Do you think there's a difference, Hillary, in seeing you running and campaigning versus governing? Or --
SECRETARY CLINTON: Could be. Could be.
QUESTION: But you â€” do you have a -- do you give it any thought?
SECRETARY CLINTON: I really don't. I really don't.
QUESTION: Okay. Well, you're too busy to even think about it. So there we have â€” a lot of people think you've got to run in 2016
and that service is so important to you that, ultimately, if it's there, they can't imagine you would say no. Now of course, it's not as
easy as everybody thinks it's going to be. (Laughter.) They think it's going to be there for the taking for you.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Right, right. Well, but I have always believed in service, but I did not for â€” what, 53 years of my life â€”
ever believe I would run for office. I respected people who did like my husband and supported a lot of candidates over the course of
my adulthood and â€” actually even before â€” I was a Goldwater girl when I was â€” I don't know â€” whatever glade I was.
So I don't know why it would be surprising that I said, look, I intend to do service, but I intend to do service in a different capacity â€”
going back to the advocacy community, working on women and girls, working in the Clinton Foundation, Clinton Global Initiative --
QUESTION: So you wouldn't start your own foundation since you've got that big apparatus there that's so successful.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, yeah. I mean, I think â€” I mean, and it seems to me that there's just a great opportunity to expand
what we're doing, to deepen it in areas that I'm interested in. But again, I haven't made any decisions. I just know that I will always
want to be of service. I believe in service. And one of my mentors, Marian Wright Edelman, and â€” used to quote all the time that
service is the rent we pay for living on this earth, and I think that's exactly right.
QUESTION: But you're not ruling it out?
SECRETARY CLINTON: I have ruled it out. I have ruled it out. (Laughter.)
QUESTION: Oh, my God. I don't want you to say that. I think it would be more fun if you said â€” (laughter) â€” I've not ruled it
out. (Laughter.)
SECRETARY CLINTON: That's funny.
QUESTION: Seriously. Okay. So is there anything else that â€” in this action profile about you that you think I've got to include that
I'm missing.

SECRETARY CLINTON: Oh, my gosh. I don't know.
QUESTION: Of course, I wanted to talk to the President and Chelsea, but Philippe said no.
STAFF: I did.
QUESTION: And he did. (Laughter.)
SECRETARY CLINTON: Yeah. He's a hard taskmaster.
QUESTION: Isn't he?
SECRETARY CLINTON: I don't know. I'll think about it. I mean, I that period was so â€”
QUESTION: It was so jam-packed.
SECRETARY CLINTON: -- jam-packed.
STAFF: (Inaudible) you have to be more specific. What did you actually want?
QUESTION: What do you mean?
STAFF: Tell her what you actually asked for.
QUESTION: Oh. Oh, I wanted â€” you mean, like, just hang out? Like, go on a --
STAFF: No. You wanted â€”
QUESTION: Oh, I wanted to have dinner in New York with you and the President and Chelsea.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Oh. (Laughter.)
QUESTION: That's what I asked for. Or breakfast.
SECRETARY CLINTON: I want to do that. (Laughter.)
QUESTION: Or coffee. (Laughter.) That's what I asked for And then I said [just want to hang out with Hillary and just know
what it's like to be Hillary. I asked for all kinds of things, and he thought I was like a nutcase.
STAFF: She wanted to take a walk with you.
QUESTION: Oh, yeah. I said I could go for a walk. Oh, God. I did once. When I did the profile of Michele Bachmann, I went for
a walk with her. Oh, my God, she like freaking wanted to kill me. Do you know what I mean'? She does this fast walk. And so I was
carrying my little recorder, and then all I could hear when I played it back was like me like that. (Laughter.) You know what I
mean? She was, like, going to run me into the damn ground.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Oh, my gosh. You did a profile on her?
QUESTION: Back when she â€” the two week period she was surging in Iowa at the start of the Republican's â€” and then she was gone
as all the Republicans popped up and then were gone.
SECRETARY CLINTON: That's funny.
QUESTION: Do you know what I mean? But anyway â€” (laughter) â€” all right, now, let's see. And then the other thing I was going
to get into was just the â€” how you have to be a leader and the muscular part of you versus the compassionate, the pragmatic part of
you, but the lofty goals part of you
SECRETARY CLINTON: Right.
QUESTION: So is there anything in this last few five weeks that you think kind of puts you there?

SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, yeah. I mean, I think - look, I mean, what happened in Benghazi, but also elsewhere in the
Middle East. I mean, I had to get on the phone and really strongly demand that governments do more to take care of our people. I had
to be present for the State Department family when we lost four colleagues and do it in a way that was respectful but demonstrating
the emotion that we all felt. So -
QUESTION: Would that be like that video hookup you did with - in -
SECRETARY CLINTON: In Libya? In Tripoli? Probably, yeah.
QUESTION: Would that be one? Or here?
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, yeah. I mean, we did so much. We reached out to so many people. I personally did.
QUESTION: And then you of course talked to his sister on the phone and stuff like that.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Yeah. So Chris's sister and then went over to - we went out to Andrews early and met all the family
members.
QUESTION: And before you got - somebody told me before you got out of the car on your way to Andrews, you were on the phone
to - which country were you on the phone and said,
""Get your people there""? Oh, Tunisia, because there were attacks still continuing there and saying, ""Get your people out there. No
excuses."" Was it something like that?
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, we had -
QUESTION: Was it something like that? Would that be accurate?
SECRETARY CLINTON: There were a lot of calls like that. We had a lot of threats.
QUESTION: So you had to be kind of a hard-ass.
SECRETARY CLINTON: We had a lot of threats everywhere. So - and remember, in a lot of these places, the security systems
just disappeared after the dictators disappeared. And so there's a difference between some countries where they did not have the
capacity, but they had the will and countries that don't have either the will or the capacity and counties that have the capacity but
without the will. So you have to zero in on what the right message is to each of those.
QUESTION: Well, what can you do if they have the capacity but not the will?
SECRETARY CLINTON: You just have to up the pressure as much as you can.
QUESTION: And how do you do that?
SECRETARY CLINTON: You get everybody you can on the phone, you get everybody calling everybody who needs to be on the
phone, and you basically both appeal to them doing the right thing and threaten them if they don't.
QUESTION: Which country would that have been?
SECRETARY CLINTON: No. No further than that. (Laughter.)
QUESTION: Okay. All right. Okay. And then -
STAFF: That piece of paper was the -
QUESTION: That said she has to go? Because I could keep going to get more detail, more detail, more detail. (Laughter.)
STAFF: It's polite. We just set it up that she comes in and gets a blank piece of paper with this - (laughter) -
QUESTION: No, no. I saw it does have something written on it.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Yeah. I have to leave for the White House -
QUESTION: I couldn't read it.

SECRETARY CLINTON: -- in about five minutes.
QUESTION: Oh, okay. (Laughter.) I did look. There was something on it, but I couldn't read it, unfortunately, through it.
SECRETARY CLINTON: That's funny.
QUESTION: Anyway, okay. And then on your legacy, since you didn't really get into that, the one thing is public diplomacy to me
seems to be one part of it â€” your townterviews and then the secretary of cool thing where you came that â€” it's all kind of this public
persona.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Yeah. Yeah.
QUESTION: The brand of Secretary of State in America. The economic statecraft seemed to me to be part of your â€”
SECRETARY CLINTON: Right. That's a big part of it.
QUESTION: Okay. And in that â€”
SECRETARY CLINTON: Internet freedom. I mean, we have a long list we could give you, which I'm sure you could â€”
QUESTION: And the Asia focus, like going to Beijing, it was one of your last trips, and it was your first trip.
SECRETARY CLINTON: My first trip, absolutely.
QUESTION: And then on the Arab Spring, that was something that you all were involved in and out of Do you feel a little bit's
come back to bite you?
SECRETARY CLINTON: No.
QUESTION: Okay.
SECRETARY CLINTON: No. Because I do think that it's â€” it would be a contortion of who we are not to support people seeking
democracy and freedom and free markets.
QUESTION: Well, everybody said, actually, the day after September 11th that you had the star tone and did better than Obama. I
mean, all the critics thought you â€” everybody that we talked to thought that, that you had struck the right tone.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, look, I believe strongly that democracy is hard. It is a never-completed journey. I mean, we are
still working hard to make sure we live up to our own ideals and values, and I want to contextualize what's going on in the world. I
mean, these countries have gone frorn oppression of decades without any democratic history into a burst of revolutionary energy to try
to do something they've never done before.
And so it is hard. It's something that is going to take time, and I think the United States remains a beacon of hope and opportunity, an
example of freedom and dignity and human rights, but that doesn't mean we can control everything that happens in every country,
particularly within a revolutionary transition. But I would never have imagined that after something as horrific as the murder of our
four colleagues and the injury of others that you would have a protest â€” a pro-American protest in Libya demanding that those who
killed Chris Stevens and his colleagues were not the future that Libya wanted. I think that's a remarkable turn of events.
And so we just have to be resolved that we're going to do the best we can to stand for our values, protect ourselves in a dangerous,
fast changing world, and manage as best we can this enormous flood of change that is sweeping across the globe. But with that I'm
going to have to â€”
QUESTION: Okay. I understand.
SECRETARY CLINTON: -- head to the White House.
QUESTION: Gotcha.
SECRETARY CLINTON: All right, my dear.
QUESTION: Okay. Thank you very much.

Subject: McCain update
The Watch received the following readout of CODEL McCain's Apri123 meetings in Cairo.
Foreign Minister Alaraby:
McCain discussed his visit to Libya, emphasizing it appeared a stalemate was emerging. McCain supported the
decision to send in predator drones and would like NATO to provide equipment, as well as training, to the rebel
forces. McCain characterized the TNC as ""good people,"" but said its military was far less impressive.
Regarding the possibility of Egypt increasing aid to the TNC, Alaraby said Egypt was reluctant to provide additional
support out of concern for the estimated 1 million Egyptian nationals living in Libya.
Alaraby reiterated Egypt is in no rush to restore diplomatic relations with Iran.
Alaraby said Egypt will abide by all agreements made with Israel. He encouraged the United States to support, or
at least not oppose, recognition of Palestinian statehood in the UN.
McCain said the USG had discussed a modest assistance package for Egypt, but warned it was probably more
modest than Egypt wished given the current economic climate. McCain planned to organize a group of businessmen to
visit Egypt and encouraged Alaraby to create a more pro-business environment.
Defense Minister, Field Marshall Tantawi:
The meeting focused on Libya and strategies to increase U.S. and Egyptian assistance. The discussion was not as in
depth as McCain's meeting with the FM. Tantawi echoed Alaraby's concern about Egyptian nationals in Libya and
request for increased U.S. assistance.

Subject: McCain update
The Watch received the following readout of CODEL McCain's April 23 meetings in Cairo.
Foreign Minister Alaraby:
McCain discussed his visit to Libya, emphasizing it appeared a stalemate was emerging. McCain supported the
decision to send in predator drones and would like NATO to provide equipment, as well as training, to the rebel
forces. McCain characterized the TNC as ""good people,"" but said its military was far less impressive.
Regarding the possibility of Egypt increasing aid to the TNC, Alaraby said Egypt was reluctant to provide additional
support out of concern for the estimated 1 million Egyptian nationals living in Libya.
Alaraby reiterated Egypt is in no rush to restore diplomatic relations with Iran.
Alaraby said Egypt will abide by all agreements made with Israel. He encouraged the United States to support, or
at least not oppose, recognition of Palestinian statehood in the UN.
McCain said the USG had discussed a modest assistance package for Egypt, but warned it was probably more
modest than Egypt wished given the current economic climate. McCain planned to organize a group of businessmen to
visit Egypt and encouraged Alaraby to create a more pro-business environment.
Defense Minister, Field Marshall Tantawi:
The meeting focused on Libya and strategies to increase U.S. and Egyptian assistance. The discussion was not as in
depth as McCain's meeting with the FM. Tantawi echoed Alaraby's concern about Egyptian nationals in Libya and
request for increased U.S. assistance.

Subject: Stevens update
Security: Today's focus is on the security situation in Benghazi. There is new local reporting that hotels are being
targeted. The INC conducted a raid on a house/storage facility and found and arrested an Egyptian cell reportedly there
for the purpose of attacking hotels. It is believed they were connected to the cell arrested last week, and that
Interrogation of those arrested earlier led to this round of arrests. Ahmed Qadafadarn, cousin of Qadhafi who was
envoy to Egypt (and was rumored to have defected), is purportedly the funder and organizer of this cell.
CA updated its travel guidance to tell travelers to stay away from the Fadihi Hotel. Stevens will inform the INC this
afternoon. [NOTE: for your reference, I appended the new WM at the end of this email.]
Stevens will be meeting with MFA in one hour and will make a written request for better security at the hotel and
for better security-related coordination. He still feels comfortable in the hotel. They are looking into the idea of moving
into a villa, but that is some way off. Need to consider resource requirements (would need TDY'er with authority to sign
lease, hire local guards, etc.). Based on discussion with DS yesterday, the hotel remains the safest location. Stevens will
continue to work to have the TNC post more people outside and beef up security presence. They have a good set back
and are way off the ground.
Flights: Stevens checked with head of the airport. There are no regular humanitarian or other flights, however,
there are flights coming in and the airport could support an air bridge if any country wanted to sat one up. Stevens will
see his European counterparts this afternoon and will ask how they are bringing in their people and whether we can be
part of it.
- Trip to Rome: Stevens doesn't know yet if Jai is going to Rome. As of now, he's inclined not to go but he might
change his mind. If the Department thinks he ought to go, Stevens can pass that message. As it stands now Mahmoud
Jabril and All Tarhouni will be going.
Misrata: Stevens spoke with Brig. Gen. Hassi re Misrata. The general was pretty dear that the ostensible move by
Qadhafi forces out of the area is a ruse. They are withdrawing troops so they won't be hit by NATO, but will send them
back in in civilian clothing so they can continue killing that way. Hassi said the assertion Qadhafi would leave to the
tribes to resolve was ridiculous because there are no armed tribes around.

Subject: Stevens Update On Benghazi -- 4/26 7arn
All:
Ops has provided below the latest Stevens update on Benghazi:
â€¢ Traffkaccidenti Police have accepted the USG version of the story: that it was an accident and the
victims were not wearing seathelts. The USG employees were returning from the airport when the
incident occurred. A total of four people died and six injured. USG employee Mjuries are light if any.
Our people are standing by pending official USG instructions. Stevens notes there is a UK flight
tomorrow they could be on if necessary. The TNC wants to do a press release to quell the rumor mill.
Stevens will send the draft back to Department for L and PA clearance.
â€¢ The British envoy departs tomorrow on permanent change of station. There will be a gap before his
replacement, John Jenkins, arrives from Baghdad.
â€¢ INC head Malunoud fibril will be going to Jordan and will not be back in Benghazi until Friday. The
development is likely to he met with additional criticism that he is spending too much time abroad at the
expense of other government affairs.
Thanks,
Dan

Dear Colleagues,
S/E Chris Stevens provided the following update from Benghazi at 1200 EDT to Embassy Tripoli DCM
Polaschik and NEA/MAG Director Roebuck:
Traffic accident: Following discussions with S/E Stevens and other USG officials, the TNC has
agreed not to issue any public statement regarding the accident. S/E Stevens' USG
colleagues are waiting for guidance from their HQ regarding proposed compensation of
52,000 Libyan dinars ($43,312): 13,000 ($10,828) per victim, to cover funeral costs and other
compensation. TNC will accompany S/E Stevens on his courtesy calls on the families, to take
place either today or tomorrow. In the view of S/E Stevens, the TNC has been handling this
incident in a professional and low-profile manner.
[Note: S/E Stevens separately provided the following details of the accident: The U.S. vehicle
was traveling back from the Benghazi airport at moderate speed. The U.S. vehicle was struck
by the Libyan vehicle going at high speed in an intersection. As a correction to earlier
information - four people were killed and only two were injured.]
Police chief: S/E Stevens met with the Benghazi chief of police today, following discussions
related to the accident. The police chief is a university professor who took on these police
duties after the revolution. According to the police chief, there are only 3,000 police in the
Benghazi area, down from 6,000 prior to the revolution. Many police simply did not return to
their jobs after the revolution, as they feared retaliation. EU and UK reps have met with the

police chief to discuss possible assistance; the UK is offering body armor and radios, and is
chairing a local donor coordination working group on security issues.
TNC aoverning capacity: Following up on concerns raised by the UK Envoy regarding the
TNC's governing capacities, S/E Stevens said that there are indeed gaps in the TNC's structure
and services, as well as some concerns regarding PM-equivalent Mahmoud _fibril's prolonged
absences from Benghazi. However, the TNC is taking steps to address these concerns. The
Council is holding meetings this week to appoint Ministers-equivalent for Interior and Justice,
and will hold its first cabinet meetings this weekend (April 30-May 1) after Jibril returns from
abroad. While S/E Stevens shares the UK's concerns regarding the INC's governing
capacities, he does not think there is a need yet to address this directly with the INC. SiE
Stevens recommends that we wait to see how the INC addresses these issues over the next
week.

Special Envoy Stevens reported at 0700 EDT on 4/26:
â€¢ Traffic accident: Police have accepted the USG version of the story: that it was an accident and the
victims were not wearing seatbelts. The USG employees were returning from the airport when the
incident occurred. A total of four people died and six injured. USG employee injuries are light if any,
Our people are standing by pending official USG instructions. Stevens notes there is a UK flight
tomorrow they could be on if necessary. The TNC wants to do a press release to quell the rumor mill.
Stevens will send the draft back to Department for L and PA clearance.
â€¢ The British envoy departs tomorrow on permanent change of station. There will be a gap before his
replacement, John Jenkins, arrives from Baghdad.
â€¢ TNC head Mahmoud fibril will be going to Jordan and will not be back in Benghazi until Friday. The
development is likely to be met with additional criticism that he is spending too much time abroad at
the expense of other government affairs.

She wasn't asked about whether we had any intel. But she did make clear our
view that this started spontaneously and then evolved. The only troubling sentence relates to the
investigation, specifically: And we'll see when the investigation unfolds whether what was -- what
transpired in Benghazi might have unfolded differently in different circumstances."" But she got pushed
there.
Waiting on other transcripts.
For more on what happened and why, let's bring in the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Dr. Susan
Rice. Dr. Rice, thank you for joining us.
RICE: Good to be with you, Jake.
TAPPER: So, first of all, what is the latest you can tell us on who these attackers were at the embassy or at
the consulate in Benghazi? We're hearing that the Libyans have arrested people. They're saying that some
people involved were from outside the country, that there might have even been Al Qaida ties. What's the
latest information?
RICE: Well, Jake, first of all, it's important to know that there's an FBI investigation that has begun and
will take some time to be completed. That will tell us with certainty what transpired.
But our current best assessment, based on the information that we have at present, is that, in fact, what
this began as, it was a spontaneous -- not a premeditated -- response to what had transpired in Cairo. In
Cairo, as you know, a few hours earlier, there was a violent protest that was undertaken in reaction to this
very offensive video that was disseminated.
We believe that folks in Benghazi, a small number of people came to the embassy to -- or to the consulate,
rather, to replicate the sort of challenge that was posed in Cairo. And then as that unfolded, it seems to
have been hijacked, let us say, by some individual clusters of extremists who came with heavier weapons,
weapons that as you know in -- in the wake of the revolution in Libya are -- are quite common and
accessible. And it then evolved from there.

We'll wait to see exactly what the investigation finally confirms, but that's the best information we have at
present.
TAPPER: Why was there such a security breakdown? Why was there not better security at the compound
in Benghazi? Why were there not U.S. Marines at the embassy in Tripoli?
RICE: Well, first of all, we had a substantial security presence with our personnel...
TAPPER: Not substantial enough, though, right?
RICE: ... with our personnel and the consulate in Benghazi. Tragically, two of the four Americans who
were killed were there providing security. That was their function. And indeed, there were many other
colleagues who were doing the same with them.
It obviously didn't prove sufficient to the -- the nature of the attack and sufficient in that -- in that
moment. And that's why, obviously, we have reinforced our remaining presence in Tripoli and why the
president has very -- been very clear that in Libya and throughout the region we are going to call on the
governments, first of all, to assume their responsibilities to protect our facilities and our personnel, and
we're reinforcing our facilities and our -- our embassies where possible...
TAPPER: But why...
RICE: ... and where needed.
TAPPER: Why would we not have Marines at the embassy in Tripoli to begin with? It would seem like this
-- this is obviously an unstable country. This is a region where U.S. interests have been attacked in
previous months. Why were there not Marines there to begin with?
RICE: First of all, there are Marines in some places around the world. There are not Marines in every
facility. That depends on the circumstances. That depends on the requirements. Our presence in Tripoli,
as in Benghazi, is relatively new, as you will recall. We've been back post-revolution only for a matter of
months.
But I've visited there myself, both to Tripoli and Benghazi. I was very grateful to have a strong security
presence with me as part of our -- our embassy detachment there. So we certainly are aware that Libya is a
place where there have been increasingly some violent incidents. The security personnel that the State
Department thought were required were in place. And we'll see when the investigation unfolds whether
what was -- what transpired in Benghazi might have unfolded differently in different circumstances.
But the president has been very clear. The protection of American personnel and facilities is and will
remain our top priority. That's why we've reinforced our presence in Tripoli and elsewhere.

TAPPER: Look at this map, if you would. There have been protests around the world over the last several
days. And President Obama pledged to repair America's relationships with the Muslim world. Why does
the U.S. seem so impotent? And why is the U.S. even less popular today in some of these Muslim and Arab
countries than it was four years ago?
RICE: Jake, we're not impotent. We're not even less popular, to challenge that assessment. I don't know
on what basis you make that judgment. But let me -- let me point...
TAPPER: It just seems that the U.S. government is powerless as this -- as this maelstrom erupts.
RICE: It's actually the opposite. First of all, let's be clear about what transpired here. What happened this
week in Cairo, in Benghazi, in many other parts of the region...
TAPPER: Tunisia, Khartoum...
RICE: ... was a result a direct result of a heinous and offensive video that was widely disseminated, that
the U.S. government had nothing to do with, which we have made clear is reprehensible and disgusting.
We have also been very clear in saying that there is no excuse for violence, there is -- that we have
condemned it in the strongest possible terms.
But let's look at what's happened. It's quite the opposite of being impotent. We have worked with the
governments in Egypt. President Obama picked up the phone and talked to President Morsi in Egypt. And
as soon as he did that, the security provided to our personnel in our embassies dramatically increased.
President Morsi...
TAPPER: It took two days for President Morsi to say anything about this.
RICE: President Morsi has been out repeatedly and said that he condemns this violence. He's called off --
and his people have called off any further demonstrations and have made very clear that this has to stop.
(CROSSTALK)
RICE: Now, and and same, frankly, in Tunisia, in Yemen, and, of course, in Libya, where the
government has -- has gone out of its way to try to step up security and express deepest remorse for what
has happened. We are quite popular in Libya, as you might expect, having been a major partner in their
revolution. What transpired outside of our consulate in Benghazi was not an expression of deep-seated
anti-Americanism on the part of the Libyan people. Quite the contrary. The counter-demonstrations, the
outpouring of sympathy and support for Ambassador Stevens and for the United States, the government
of Libya and -- and the people on the street saying how pained they are by this, is much more a reflection
of the sentiment towards the United States than a small handful of heavily armed mobsters.

TAPPER: That certainly, according to polling, is the case in Libya. Not the case in Egypt. And since you
brought up President Morsi, let me try to get some clarification on something. President Obama was asked
about the relationship with Egypt on Wednesday, and this is what he said.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
OBAMA: I don't think that we would consider them an ally, but we don't consider them an enemy. They
are a new government that is trying to find its way.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
TAPPER: The United States has sent billions of dollars of U.S. taxpayer money to Egypt over the last few
decades. And by definition, as you know, according to the State Department, Egypt is a major non-NATO
ally of the United States. Why would President Obama say Egypt is not an ally?
RICE: Well, first of all, the president has been very clear and -- and everybody understands that Egypt is a
very critical partner of the United States, has long been so. That relationship remains the same, and the
president wasn't signaling any change in -- in the nature...
TAPPER: Was he trying to nudge Morsi?
RICE: The president wasn't signaling any change in the nature of our relationship. Obviously, the
president had a conversation with President Morsi and a very productive one, in which he underscored
that it's, of course, the responsibility of the Egyptian government as host to protect diplomatic personnel
and facilities, including our own, and we saw that President Morsi, immediately after that, took dramatic
steps to improve the security of our facilities in Cairo and elsewhere, and then went out and repeatedly
made a number of very important and powerful statements condemning the violence and conveying the
message that, however hateful such a video may be, there is absolutely no justification for violence against
the United States or other Western partners.
So what we've seen is that the president has been incredibly calm, incredibly steady, and incredibly
measured in his approach to this set of developments. And his interventions, his leadership has ensured
that in Egypt, in Yemen, in Tunisia, in Libya, and many other parts of the world, that leaders have come
out and made very plain that there's no excuse for this violence. We heard Prime Minister Erdogan of
Turkey say the same, we heard the Grand Mufti in Saudi Arabia say the same, that there's no excuse for
violence, that violence is to be condemned, and that governments have a responsibility to protect United
States personnel and facilities and those of all foreign diplomats.
TAPPER: I know you have to go, but very quickly, was the president in that interview trying to nudge
President Morsi, ""Get your act together""?

Re: Bin Laden, AQ & Libya
Latest report:
During the early morning of May 2, 2011 sources with access to the leadership of the Libyan rebellion's ruling Transitional
National Council (TNC) stated in confidence that they are concerned that the death of al Qa'ida leader Osama Bin Laden
will inspire al Qa'ida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) to use weapons they have obtained, which were originally intended
for the rebels in Libya, to retaliate against the United States and its allies for this attack in Pakistan. These individuals fear
that the use of the weapons in this manner will complicate the TNC's relationship with NATO and the United States,
whose support is vital to them in their struggle with the forces of Muammar al Qaddafi. In this regard they are concerned
that U.S. officials will believe reports, often created by the Tripoli Government, regarding the degree of influence exercised
by AQIM on the TNC.
These individuals note that the INC officials are reacting to reports received during the week of April 25 from their own
sources of information, the French General Directorate for External Security (DOSE), and British external intelligence
service (MI-6), stating that AQIM has acquired about 10 SAM 7- Grail/Streela man-portable air-defense systems
(MANPADS or MPADS) from illegal weapons markets in Western Niger and Northern Mali. These weapons were
originally intended for sale to the rebel forces in Libya, but AQIM operatives were able to meet secretly with these arms
dealers and purchase the equipment. The acquisition of these sophisticated weapons creates a serious threat to air traffic
in Southern Morocco, Algeria, Northern Mali, Western Niger, and Eastern Mauritania.
(Source Comment: According to very sensitive sources, the Libyan rebels are concerned that AQIM may also obtain
SPIGOTT wire-guided anti-tank missiles and an unspecified number of Russian anti-tank mines made of plastic and
undetectable by anti-mine equipment. This equipment again was coming through Niger and Mali, and was intended for the
rebels in Libya. They note that AQIM is very strong in this region of Northwest Africa.)
In the opinion of these knowledgeable individuals, Libyan rebel commanders are also concerned that the death of Bin
Laden comes at a time when sensitive information indicates that the leaders of AQIM are planning to launch attacks
across North Africa and Europe in an effort to reassert their relevance during the ongoing upheavals in Libya, as well as
the rest of North Africa and the Middle East. They believe the first step in this campaign was the April 30 bombing of a
cafe in Marrakesh, Morocco that is frequented by Western tourists. These individuals point out that AQIM also maintains
a wide reach in Europe.

The TNC leaders are also concerned that, with the death of Saif al-Arab Qaddafi, the youngest son of Muammar Qaddafi,
the Tripoli Government may pursue retaliation against the United States and its Western allies through surrogate terrorist
groups, particularly Hezbollah. While the deaths of Sin Laden and Saif al-Arab are completely unrelated, two separate
and very dangerous groups will now be looking for revenge against the U.S. and its allies.
(Source Comment These knowledgeable sources believe that the leaders of the TNC are also worried about the reaction
to the death of Bin Laden among rebel fighters and their supporters in Libya and Egypt, where the al Qa'ida leader was
very popular. These INC officials do not want the death of Bin Laden to affect their relations with the West or their
support from NATO, the U.S., France, or Great Britain.)

In the opinion of these knowledgeable individuals. Libyan rebel commanders are also concerned
that the death of Bin f,aden comes at a time when sensitive information indicates that the leaders
of AQIM are planning to launch attacks across North Africa and Europe in an effort to reassert
their relevance during the ongoing upheavals in Libya, as well as the rest of North Africa and the
Middle East. They believe the first step in this campaign was the Aptil 30 bombing of a cafe in
Marrakesh, Morocco that is frequented by Western tourists. These individuals point out that
AQIM also maintains a wide reach in Europe.
The TNC leaders are also concerned that, with the death of Saif al-Arab Qaddafi, the youngest
son of Muammar Qaddafi, the Tripoli Government may pursue retaliation against the United
States and its Western allies through surrogate terrorist groups. particularly Hezbollah. While
the deaths of Bin Laden and Saif al-Arab are completely unrelated, two separate and very
dangerous groups will now be looking for revenge against the U.S. and its allies.
(Source Comment: These knowledgeable sources believe that the leaders of the TNC are also
worried about the reaction to the death of Bin Laden among rebel fighters and their supporters in
Libya and Egypt, where the al Qa'ida leader was very popular. These TNC officials do not want
the death of Bin Laden to affect their relations with the West or their support from NATO, the
U.S., France, or Great Britain.)

Re: Bin Laden, AQ & Libya
Latest report:
During the early morning of May 2, 2011 sources with access to the leadership of the Libyan
rebellion's ruling Transitional National Council (INC) stated in confidence that they are
concerned that the death of al Qa-ida leader Osama Bin Laden will inspire al Qa'ida in the
Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) to use weapons they have obtained, akihich were originally intended for
the rebels in Libya, to retaliate against the United States and its allies for this attack in Pakistan.
These individuals fear that the use of the weapons in this manner will complicate the INC's
relationship with NATO and the United States, whose support is vital to them in their struggle
with the forces of Muammar al Qaddafi. In this regard they are concerned that U.S. officials will
believe reports, often created by the Tripoli Government, regarding the degree of influence
exercised by AQIM on the TNC.
These individuals note that the TNC officials are reacting to reports received during the week of
April 25 from their own sources of information, the French General Directorate for External
Security (DGSE), and British external intelligence service (MI-6), stating that AQIM has
acquired about 10 SAM 7- GrailiStreela man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS or
MPADS) from illegal weapons markets in Western Niger and Northern Mali. These weapons
were originally intended for sale to the rebel forces in Libya, but AQIM operatives were able to
meet secretly with these arms dealers and purchase the equipment The acquisition of these
sophisticated weapons creates a serious threat to air traffic in Southern Morocco, Algeria,
Northern Mali, Western Niger, and Eastern Mauritania.
(Source Comment: According to very sensitive sources, the Libyan rebels are concerned that
AQIM may also obtain SPIGOTT wire-guided anti-tank missiles and an unspecified number of
Russian anti-tank mines made of plastic and undetectable by anti-mine equipme.nt. This
equipment again was coming through Niger and Mali, and was intended for the rebels in Libya.

Re: Bin Laden, AQ & Libya
Latest report:
During the early morning of May 2, 2011 sources with access to the leadership of the Libyan rebellion's ruling Transitional
National Council (TNC) stated in confidence that they are concerned that the death of al Qa'ida leader Osama Bin Laden
will inspire al Qa'ida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) to use weapons they have obtained, which were originally intended
for the rebels in Libya, to retaliate against the United States and its allies for this attack in Pakistan. These individuals fear
that the use of the weapons in this manner will complicate the INC 's relationship with NATO and the United States,
whose support is vital to them in their struggle with the forces of Muarnmar al Qaddafi. In this regard they are concerned
that U.S. officials will believe reports, often created by the Tripoli Government, regarding the degree of influence exercised
by AQIM on the INC.
These individuals note that the TNC officials are reacting to reports received during the week of April 25 from their own
sources of information, the French General Directorate for External Security (DGSE), and British external intelligence
service (MI-6), stating that AQIM has acquired about 10 SAM 7- Grail/Streela man-portable air-defense systems
(MANPADS or MPADS) from illegal weapons markets in Western Niger and Northern Mali. These weapons were
originally intended for sale to the rebel forces in Libya, but AQIM operatives were able to meet secretly with these arms
dealers and purchase the equipment. The acquisition of these sophisticated weapons creates a serious threat to air traffic
in Southern Morocco, Algeria, Northern Mali, Western Niger, and Eastern Mauritania.
(Source Comment. According to very sensitive sources, the Libyan rebels are concerned that AQIM may also obtain
SPIGOTT wire-guided anti-tank missiles and an unspecified number of Russian anti-tank mines made of plastic and
undetectable by anti-mine equipment. This equipment again was coming through Niger and Mali, and was intended for the
rebels in Libya. They note that AQIM is very strong in this region of Northwest Africa.)

In the opinion of these knowledgeable individuals, Libyan rebel commanders are also concerned that the death of Bin
Laden comes at a time when sensitive information indicates that the leaders of AQIM are planning to launch attacks
across North Africa and Eurcipe in an effort to reassert their relevance during the ongoing upheavals in Libya, as well as
the rest of North Africa and the Middle East. They believe the first step in this campaign was the April 30 bombing of a
cafe in Marrakesh, Morocco that is frequented by Western tourists. These individuals point out that AQIM also maintains
a wide reach in Europe.
The TNC leaders are also concerned that, with the death of Saif al-Arab Qaddafi, the youngest son of Muammar Qaddafi,
the Tripoli Government may pursue retaliation against the United States and its Western allies through surrogate terrorist
groups, particularly Hezbollah. While the deaths of Bin Laden and Saif al-Arab are completely unrelated, two separate
and very dangerous groups will now be looking for revenge against the U.S. and its allies.
(Source Comment: These knowledgeable sources believe that the leaders of the INC are also worried about the reaction
to the death of Bin Laden among rebel fighters and their supporters in Libya and Egypt, where the al Qa'ida leader was
very popular. These TNC officials do not want the death of Bin Laden to affect their relations with the West or their
support from NATO, the U.S., France, or Great Britain.)

Subject: Q re HbJ
Jake,
The Secretary asked me this afternoon about timing for a call/meeting with Hb1 on the Syrian opposition. I told
her wanted to consult with Robert to double check on this:
Robert agrees that 1-1131 remains quite involved in the Syria issue. For instance, when he was in the London meeting on
the Syria opposition just before UNGA, the Qatari rep got Hill on the phone in minutes during the meeting to weigh in
on a Q re the SNC â€” and HbJ's view carried the day.
We are now sending to Amb Susan Ziadeh the list of organizations that we want to Qataris to contact inside Syria to ask
them to choose reps to send to Doha. We are also sending her the list of names we are socializing for consideration for
the 'political council"" Susan can discuss these lists in Doha on Sunday, so it would make sense for S to wait until
Monday or Tuesday to engage with HbJ on some of these ideas for managing the conference and its outcomes.
Robert confirms that there is a lot of talk about the Doha meeting being postponed for a few days, but there is no new
firm date. We are quite comfortable with a delay as it gives us (and others) time to press for good
representation/participation and a better outcome. The idea of a follow-on conference in Cairo is still very much alive.
She suggested she might also check with Hb1 on whether he is planning a trip here anytime soon. Meeting him in person
would be great if he's planning a trip here.
II send a note up on Monday with some ideas on the Libya meeting that the Secretary asked about.

Re: Bin Laden, AQ & Libya
Latest report:
During the early morning of May 2, 2011 sources with access to the leadership of the Libyan rebellion's ruling Transitional
National Council (TNC) stated in confidence that they are concerned that the death of al Qa'ida leader Osama Bin Laden
will inspire al Qa`ida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) to use weapons they have obtained, which were originally intended
for the rebels in Libya, to retaliate against the United States and its allies for this attack in Pakistan. These individuals fear
that the use of the weapons in this manner will complicate the TNC's relationship with NATO and the United States,
whose support is vital to them in their struggle with the forces of Muammar al Qaddafi. In this regard they are concerned
that U.S. officials will believe reports, often created by the Tripoli Government, regarding the degree of influence exercised
by AQIM on the TNC.
These individuals note that the TNC officials are reacting to reports received during the week of April 25 from their own
sources of information, the French General Directorate for External Security (DGSE), and British external intelligence
service (MI-6), stating that AQIM has acquired about 10 SAM 7- Grail/Streela man-portable air-defense systems

or MPADS) from illegal weapons markets in Western Niger and Northern Mali. These weapons were
originally intended for sale to the rebel forces in Libya, but AQIM operatives were able to meet secretly with these arms
dealers and purchase the equipment. The acquisition of these sophisticated weapons creates a serious threat to air traffic
in Southern Morocco, Algeria, Northern Mali, Western Niger, and Eastern Mauritania.
(Source Comment: According to very sensitive sources, the Libyan rebels are concerned that AQIM may also obtain
SPIGOTT wire-guided anti-tank missiles and an unspecified number of Russian anti-tank mines made of plastic and
undetectable by anti-mine equipment. This equipment again was coming through Niger and Mali, and was intended for the
rebels in Libya. They note that AQIM is very strong in this region of Northwest Africa.)
In the opinion of these knowledgeable individuals, Libyan rebel commanders are also concerned that the death of Bin
Laden comes at a time when sensitive information indicates that the leaders of AQIM are planning to launch attacks
across North Africa and Europe in an effort to reassert their relevance during the ongoing upheavals in Libya, as well as
the rest of North Africa and the Middle East. They believe the first stop In this campaign was the April X) bombing of a
cafe in Marrakesh, Morocco that is frequented by Western tourists. These individuals point out that AQIM also maintains
a wide reach in Europe.
The INC leaders are also concerned that, with the death of Salt al-Arab Qaddafi, the youngest son of Muammar Qaddafi,
the Tripoli Government may pursue retaliation against the United States and its Western allies through surrogate terrorist
groups, particularly HerbÂ°Mk While the deaths of Bin Laden and Saif al-Arab are completely unrelated, two separate
and very dangerous groups will now be looking for revenge against the U.S. and its allies.
(Source Comment: These knowledgeable sources believe that the loaders of the INC are also worried about the reaction
to the death of Bin Laden among rebel fighters and their supporters in Libya and Egypt, where the al Qa'ida leader was
very popular. These INC officials do not want the death of Bin Laden to affect their relations with the West or their
support from NATO, the U.S., France, or Great Britain.)

Libyan Ambassador's Death Not a Political Issue, Says Dad
By Margaret Talev on October 14, 2012
BusinessWeek
Bloomberg News
The father of Christopher Stevens, the U.S. ambassador to Libya who was killed in the attack in Benghazi last month, said
his son's death shouldn't be politicized in the presidential campaign.
""it would really be abhorrent to make this into a campaign issue,"" Jan Stevens, 77, said in a telephone interview from his
home in Loomis, California, as he prepares for a memorial service for his son next week.
Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee, has criticized President Barack Obama for not providing adequate security in
Libya, saying the administration has left the country exposed to a deadly terrorist attack.
The ambassador's father, a lawyer, said politicians should await the findings of a formal investigation before making
accusations or judgments.
""The security matters are being adequately investigated,"" Stevens said. ""We don't pretend to be experts in security. It
has to be objectively examined. That's where it belongs. It does not belong in the campaign arena."" Stevens said he has
been getting briefings from the State Department on the progress of the investigation.
'Very Optimistic'
Stevens said while he was close with his son, ""we weren't that familiar with the day-to-day activities' he undertook in
Libya. On the occasions when his son called home, Stevens said, he didn't share many details about his work other than
to say that ""he was very optimistic about the results of the election and the new government."" They last spoke by phone
in August and by e-mail days before his son's death.

Stevens, a registered Democrat, said he isn't politically active. He declined to say how he'll vote in the presidential
election.
He said his son, who was a career diplomat and had worked for Republican and Democratic presidents, hadn't expressed
concerns to him about security or support from the administration. ""He felt very strongly about Secretary Clinton,""
Stevens said, referring to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. ""He felt she was an extremely able person.""
As for whether he had the tools and protection he needed for his job, Stevens said of his son: ""We didn't get into that""
sort of discussion. ""I never heard him say a critical word about the State Department or the administration, or any
administration for that matter. He came up through the foreign service, not politics.""
Obama Call
Stevens said neither of the two presidential campaigns reached out to him, and that he is grateful for that. He said
Obama telephoned him after his son's death to express his regrets and talk about identifying the perpetrators who
should be brought to justice, and that the conversation was in the context of his presidential duties and not political.
While polls indicate that voters say Obama would do a better job on foreign policy issues, Republicans see an
opportunity to cut into that advantage, pointing to surveys showing that voters have grown less satisfied since the Sept.
11 assault in Libya.
Stevens stopped short of directly criticizing either candidate.
""I'm not sure exactly what he's been saying and not saying, but our position is it would be a real shame if this were
politicized,"" Stevens said, referring to Romney. ""Our concern now is memorializing Chris and remembering his
contribution to the country.""
Campaign Shift
Romney's current foreign policy position marks a shift in tone from a campaign that has focused almost exclusively on
economic issues and jobs.
The Romney team is attempting to link two campaign messages by charging Obama with weakening American interests
abroad at the same time as he's failed to boost the economy back home.
Speaking to voters on Oct. 12 in Richmond, Virginia, Romney chastised Vice President Joe Biden for his defense of the
administration's actions in the Libya attack.
""He's doubling down on denial, and we need to understand exactly what happened as opposed to just having people
brush this aside,"" Romney said.
During last week's vice presidential debate, Biden said the White House wasn't told of a request for additional security
at the mission in Benghazi the month before the incident.
State Department official Eric Nordstrom, who served as a regional security officer in Tripoli until July, told a
congressional committee that he was turned down when he requested an extension of a 16-member security support
team that was scheduled to leave Libya in August.

Romney hasn't specified what he would do differently than the administration in Libya. In a speech at the Virginia
Military Institute earlier last week, he called for support of Libya's ""efforts to forge a lasting government"" and to pursue
the ""terrorists who attacked our consulate.""
That view is at odds with the position Romney took more than a year ago, when he opposed expanding the intervention
in Libya to capture Muammar Qaddafi, calling it ""mission creep and mission muddle"" in April 2011.
Neither the administration's initial public report that the attack began with a spontaneous demonstration against an
anti- Islamic video clip nor Republican suggestions that it was a planned attack tied to al-Qaeda are supported by U.S.
intelligence reports or by accounts of the night provided to a Bloomberg reporter by Benghazi residents.
White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters that ""the president wants to get to the bottom of what
happened.""
Carney also sought to minimize questions about why the president and other administration officials were slow to
publicly acknowledge the role of terrorism in the attack.
""As time went on, additional information became available,"" Carney said. ""Clearly, we know more today than we did on
the Sunday after the attack. But as the process moves forward and more information becomes available, we will be sure
to continue consulting with you.""

Subject: Rice on ""This Week""
Here is Susan on this week. She wasn't asked about whether we had any intel. But she did make clear our
view that this started spontaneously and then evolved. The only troubling sentence relates to the
investigation, specifically: And we'll see when the investigation unfolds whether what was -- what
transpired in Benghazi might have unfolded differently in different circumstances."" But she got pushed
there.
Waiting on other transcripts.
For more on what happened and why, let's bring in the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Dr. Susan
Rice. Dr. Rice, thank you for joining us.
RICE: Good to be with you, Jake.
TAPPER: So, first of all, what is the latest you can tell us on who these attackers were at the embassy or at
the consulate in Benghazi? We're hearing that the Libyans have arrested people. They're saying that some
people involved were from outside the country, that there might have even been Al Qaida ties. What's the
latest information?
RICE: Well, Jake, first of all, it's important to know that there's an FBI investigation that has begun and
will take some time to be completed. That will tell us with certainty what transpired.
But our current best assessment, based on the information that we have at present, is that, in fact, what
this began as, it was a spontaneous -- not a premeditated -- response to what had transpired in Cairo. In
Cairo, as you know, a few hours earlier, there was a violent protest that was undertaken in reaction to this
very offensive video that was disseminated.
We believe that folks in Benghazi, a small number of people came to the embassy to -- or to the consulate,
rather, to replicate the sort of challenge that was posed in Cairo. And then as that unfolded, it seems to
have been hijacked, let us say, by some individual clusters of extremists who came with heavier weapons,
weapons that as you know in -- in the wake of the revolution in Libya are -- are quite common and
accessible. And it then evolved from there.

We'll wait to see exactly what the investigation finally confirms, but that's the best information we have at
present.
TAPPER: Why was there such a security breakdown? Why was there not better security at the compound
in Benghazi? Why were there not U.S. Marines at the embassy in Tripoli?
RICE: Well, first of all, we had a substantial security presence with our personnel...
TAPPER: Not substantial enough, though, right?
RICE: ... with our personnel and the consulate in Benghazi. Tragically, two of the four Americans who
were killed were there providing security. That was their function. And indeed, there were many other
colleagues who were doing the same with them.
It obviously didn't prove sufficient to the -- the nature of the attack and sufficient in that -- in that
moment. And that's why, obviously, we have reinforced our remaining presence in Tripoli and why the
president has very -- been very clear that in Libya and throughout the region we are going to call on the
governments, first of all, to assume their responsibilities to protect our facilities and our personnel, and
we're reinforcing our facilities and our -- our embassies where possible...
TAPPER: But why...
RICE: ... and where needed.
TAPPER: Why would we not have Marines at the embassy in Tripoli to begin with? It would seem like this
-- this is obviously an unstable country. This is a region where U.S. interests have been attacked in
previous months. Why were there not Marines there to begin with?
RICE: First of all, there are Marines in some places around the world. There are not Marines in every
facility. That depends on the circumstances. That depends on the requirements. Our presence in Tripoli,
as in Benghazi, is relatively new, as you will recall. We've been back post-revolution only for a matter of
months.
But I've visited there myself, both to Tripoli and Benghazi. I was very grateful to have a strong security
presence with me as part of our -- our embassy detachment there. So we certainly are aware that Libya is a
place where there have been increasingly some violent incidents. The security personnel that the State
Department thought were required were in place. And we'll see when the investigation unfolds whether
what was -- what transpired in Benghazi might have unfolded differently in different circumstances.
But the president has been very clear. The protection of American personnel and facilities is and will
remain our top priority. That's why we've reinforced our presence in Tripoli and elsewhere.

TAPPER: Look at this map, if you would. There have been protests around the world over the last several
days. And President Obama pledged to repair America's relationships with the Muslim world. Why does
the U.S. seem so impotent? And why is the U.S. even less popular today in some of these Muslim and Arab
countries than it was four years ago?
RICE: Jake, we're not impotent. We're not even less popular, to challenge that assessment. I don't know
on what basis you make that judgment. But let me -- let me point...
TAPPER: It just seems that the U.S. government is powerless as this -- as this maelstrom erupts.
RICE: It's actually the opposite. First of all, let's be clear about what transpired here. What happened this
week in Cairo, in Benghazi, in many other parts of the region...
TAPPER: Tunisia, Khartoum...
RICE: ... was a result a direct result of a heinous and offensive video that was widely disseminated, that
the U.S. government had nothing to do with, which we have made clear is reprehensible and disgusting.
We have also been very clear in saying that there is no excuse for violence, there is -- that we have
condemned it in the strongest possible terms.
But let's look at what's happened. It's quite the opposite of being impotent. We have worked with the
governments in Egypt. President Obama picked up the phone and talked to President Morsi in Egypt. And
as soon as he did that, the security provided to our personnel in our embassies dramatically increased.
President Morsi...
TAPPER: It took two days for President Morsi to say anything about this.
RICE: President Morsi has been out repeatedly and said that he condemns this violence. He's called off --
and his people have called off any further demonstrations and have made very clear that this has to stop.
(CROSSTALK)
RICE: Now, and and same, frankly, in Tunisia, in Yemen, and, of course, in Libya, where the
government has -- has gone out of its way to try to step up security and express deepest remorse for what
has happened. We are quite popular in Libya, as you might expect, having been a major partner in their
revolution. What transpired outside of our consulate in Benghazi was not an expression of deep-seated
anti-Americanism on the part of the Libyan people. Quite the contrary. The counter-demonstrations, the
outpouring of sympathy and support for Ambassador Stevens and for the United States, the government
of Libya and -- and the people on the street saying how pained they are by this, is much more a reflection
of the sentiment towards the United States than a small handful of heavily armed mobsters.

TAPPER: That certainly, according to polling, is the case in Libya. Not the case in Egypt. And since you
brought up President Morsi, let me try to get some clarification on something. President Obama was asked
about the relationship with Egypt on Wednesday, and this is what he said.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
OBAMA: I don't think that we would consider them an ally, but we don't consider them an enemy. They
are a new government that is trying to find its way.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
TAPPER: The United States has sent billions of dollars of U.S. taxpayer money to Egypt over the last few
decades. And by definition, as you know, according to the State Department, Egypt is a major non-NATO
ally of the United States. Why would President Obama say Egypt is not an ally?
RICE: Well, first of all, the president has been very clear and -- and everybody understands that Egypt is a
very critical partner of the United States, has long been so. That relationship remains the same, and the
president wasn't signaling any change in -- in the nature...
TAPPER: Was he trying to nudge Morsi?
RICE: The president wasn't signaling any change in the nature of our relationship. Obviously, the
president had a conversation with President Morsi and a very productive one, in which he underscored
that it's, of course, the responsibility of the Egyptian government as host to protect diplomatic personnel
and facilities, including our own, and we saw that President Morsi, immediately after that, took dramatic
steps to improve the security of our facilities in Cairo and elsewhere, and then went out and repeatedly
made a number of very important and powerful statements condemning the violence and conveying the
message that, however hateful such a video may be, there is absolutely no justification for violence against
the United States or other Western partners.
So what we've seen is that the president has been incredibly calm, incredibly steady, and incredibly
measured in his approach to this set of developments. And his interventions, his leadership has ensured
that in Egypt, in Yemen, in Tunisia, in Libya, and many other parts of the world, that leaders have come
out and made very plain that there's no excuse for this violence. We heard Prime Minister Erdogan of
Turkey say the same, we heard the Grand Mufti in Saudi Arabia say the same, that there's no excuse for
violence, that violence is to be condemned, and that governments have a responsibility to protect United
States personnel and facilities and those of all foreign diplomats.
TAPPER: I know you have to go, but very quickly, was the president in that interview trying to nudge
President Morsi, ""Get your act together""?

RICE: No. I think that the president communicated directly with -- with President Morsi and had the
opportunity to -- to understand our expectation that Egypt will do what it can to protect our facilities. So
that -- that was conveyed very directly, and the results were immediate and quite satisfactory.
TAPPER: Dr. Rice, thank you so much for coming here today and answering our questions.
RICE: Good to be with you.

From: Sid
Re: Q's secret bid to UK
On the morning of June 2, 2011 sensitive sources with access to the advisors to Muamrnar Qaddafi's son, Saif
al-Islam, stated in strict confidence that the Libyan government has opened extremely complicated negotiations
with the government of the United Kingdom (UK) in an effort to obtain their support in reaching a ceasefire
agreement with the rebels of the Libyan Transitional National Council (TNC), allowing the Qaddafi's to
maintain some level of control in the country.
This initiative is directed by Saif al-Islam and, according to these sensitive sources. the Libyans have asked the
UK officials to broker a deal with the INC that will allow some form of power sharing, with the possibility of
Saif al-Islam acting as head of state and the TNC members making up a substantial portion of the cabinet in a
new government. Under the plan Muatnmar Qaddafi would be allowed to leave the country and go into exile
with no danger of indictment on charges of human rights abuses and corruption by Libyan or international
courts.
(Source Comment: In the opinion of these sensitive sources, this initiative reflects the concern of the Qaddafi
government that as a result of continuing NATO air raids against their forces, they can no longer defeat the
rebel army. They add that there has been no firm response from the UK government, and the initial discussions
have been conducted by officers of the British Special Intelligence Service (SIS / MI-6). In the opinion of these
same sources the initial idea of these talks may have been raised by former Libyan Foreign Minister Mousa
Kousa, after his arrival in London in late March 2011.)
According to these sensitive sources, Saif al-Islam and his advisors realize that there is little chance the TNC
will agree to such an offer, and that SIS may be using this contact as a means of collecting intelligence while
protecting British interests in Libya. Notwithstanding this concern, in the opinion of these individuals, Sail al-
Islam believes that introducing the possibility of a ceasefire and the subsequent negotiations may create
divisions within NATO and weaken their military operations against Qaddafi's forces.

(Source Comment: These sources add that many of Saif al-Islam's advisors do not know if, or to what extent,
the UK Government has shared knowledge of this initiative with the governments of the United States and the
other NATO allies.)
At the same time, sources with access to the operations of the INC military committee state privately that on
June 1, 2011 Libyan intelligence officers detonated a car bomb outside the Tibesti Hotel in the TNC capital of
Benghazi. One person was injured in the blast and a number of nearby vehicles were damaged. TNC security
officers occupied the hotel and the surrounding area immediately after the attack, but were not able to identify
any of the attackers. The Tibesti Hotel is an important landmark in the heart of Benghazi and is used by the
TNC government, as well by foreign journalists and diplomats. Hotel security has been heightened in the hours
following the attack and all foreign residents are under surveillance by TNC security officers, looking for
suspicious activities and contacts.

representative, Chris Stevens, in meetings with a large number of representatives from the TNC, civil society, UN
organizations and NG0s, and the diplomatic corps. While we had no idea that our trip would correspond with significant
military advances in the east and the start of the coordinated Tripoli uprising dubbed ""Operation Mermaid Dawn,"" the
timing gave us the opportunity to note the contrast between the relative bureaucratic quiet here compared to hyped-up
activity in western Libya. Clearly, some coordination is underway between Benghazi and the west: Ali Tarhouni, recently
promoted to Deputy Prime Minister In a still-to-be-completed cabinet reshufle, previewed the Tripoli uprising with us,
down almost to the minute. Yet one feels that, to a large extent, TNC officials are observers and chroniclers rather than
the authors of the unfolding developments to the west. (In a telling anecdote, just after confiding in us the plans for
Tripoli about to unfold, Tarhouni turned off his ringing cell phone, to concentrate on talking to us in a leisurely
manner.) What TNC officials told us to a large extent was sensible and mostly reassuring in its content -- and the TNC
just issued a directive reiterating its policy to treat combatants according to the Geneva conventions and observe human
rights -- but their comments fell mostly in the category of passive analysis rather than aggressive forward
thinking. Washington has task forces in focused on Tripoli; Benghazi does not
While there's a sense in the air that the final battles have begun, that palpable anticipation does not seem to have
translated into the type of stepped-up bureaucratic activity that one would expect. After meeting with us for nearly two
hours on Thursday, TNC Executive Committee chair (and PM equivalent) Mahmoud Jibril returned to Doha rather than
head any kind of war room here. I was on the ground far longer than Jibril, giving another cameo appearance
here. Tarhouni confided that there is no plan for when or how the TNC would relocate quickly to Tripoli, should Tripoli
fall. TNC Chairman Mustafa Abduljalil (who remains by all accounts a unifying figure here) is a humble, retiring leader,
which after Qadhafi's flamboyance is part of the attraction for Libyans but which does not make him naturally think of
how to project INC authority and symbolism quickly to the newly liberated areas. The question is when Tripoli falls, do
the extensive plans that the TNC has made about the post Qadhafi transitional structures have any relevance for
Tripoli? I do not want to overplay this: the flags being raised in the western towns are the flags used here. Our visit to
the military command center demonstrated that there is active information flow (if not exactly command and control)
passing between east and west. Tarhouni and others who visit western towns, usually from Tunis, describe support
there and from tribal leaders across Libya. No other groups are claiming to have established or planned for an
alternative civilian authority to compete with the TNC. Still, in our engagement with TNC officials, we will need to
remind them continually of the imperative to nurture their legitimacy and authority and to prevent a political vacuum
that others could fill -- especially after Tripoli falls and the INC is here, not there.
We've talked a lot about Tripoli and whether a battle for the capital could be avoided, which we argued would be the
best solution. One of the TNC's assets is the moral distinction between what the Libya that the TNC aspires to promote
and how Qadhafi has treated Libya's citizens. The world's attention will focus on a battle for Tripoli, we cautioned, and
acts of brutality and revenge and potential internal fights among competing militias will blur that moral distinction even
more than the assassination of INC Chief of Staff Abdulfatah Younis already did. The damage to the TNC's credibility
could be irreparable. We also noted that a TNC led negotiation that succeeds in winning Tripoli without a fight would
underscore the TNC leadership far more dramatically than a successful militia assault only vaguely connected to the
Benghazi leadership. The TNC officials heard us out patiently, but they clearly were not in the mood to negotiate. They
feel confident about the current military situation, and they remain convinced that Qadhafi simply will not give up no
matter how high the pressure. If anything, their positions have hardened in recent weeks, with Abduljalil telling us that
the TNC will no longer contemplate Qadhafi staying in Libya once he is out of power. Saif Qadhafi is seen in the same
category as his father. I do not believe that anything short of a significant change -- Qadhafi's departure, a military

setback that punctures the TNC's current confidence, NATO insisting on a pause in operations in favor of negotiations --
will persuade the TNC leadership that it is in their interest right now to offer Qadhafi a peaceful way out. Tarhouni also
acknowledged with his trademark candor that, to the Libyan people right now, negotiations would appear weak and
not a satisfactory climax to the revolution. They do have a point that, despite signs of desperation around Qadhafi (e.g.,
Mohammed Ismail's multiple attempts to contact Gene Cretz and me), there is no indication that Qadhafi himself is
prepared to throw in the towel. There is real fear that, should Qadhafi somehow make it from Tripoli to Sebha, a guerilla
war could persist for years, with supplies and mercernaries smuggled across the Saharan border.
Among other topics, we pushed the INC officials hard on starting a high-profile discussion immediately on the
reconciliation which is part of the TNC's platform. We noted that the many victims of Qadhafi's 42-year rule will be less
likely to pursue individual acts of revenge If they are assured that there will be some form to address grievances through
rule-of-law accountability. The same message should also appeal to average Libyans who for whatever reason remained
as part of Qadhafi's regime to the end but who have no blood on their hands and might otherwise fear retribution. INC
officials refer approvingly to the South African and Moroccan models, and they reiterated their commitment for an
inclusive process for Libya's future that welcomes all but the most notorious individuals around Qadhafi. Yet they still
seem to rely largely on (variously described) luck, tribal discipline, and the ""gentle character"" of the Libyan people as the
best assurances against abuse and revenge killings. We will continue to push on this.
Benghazi remained full of chatter about the Abdulfatah Younis assassination. With tribal visits and investigation
committees and cabinet changes, the INC addressed the immediate crisis sufficiently effectively that the intiial tension
and gunfire quickly dissipated. But the assassination highlighted two realities of Libyan life that TNC officials had
previously tried to downplay: tribes and militias. Rather than denying the tribal affiliations of Libyans, TNC officials are
now looking to the tribes as part of the solution in enforcing discipline and preventing the type of widescale looting and
pillaging that destroyed Benghazi's security infrastructure in March. Tribes, we heard, can also be a corrective balance
to Islamist leanings. On reining in the militias, we heard no good answers. Some people (Tarhouni, INC National
Security Advisor Bazama, some civil society representatives) spoke frankly about the problem, including the Islamist
leanings of the most powerful. The Islamist militias deserve more discussion in other channels, but a couple of people
noted that the Younis assassination had an upside in making scrutiny of this issue imperative. Others seemed to rely,
again, on luck or tried to avert their eyes from the problem that militias could post on the Day After. There was
widespread disdain for Qatar's role in encouraging certain militia elements, and I will be able to cite lots of concern here
when I go to Doha later. Qatar's role, too, is a subject better discussed elsewhere.
We also discussed humanitarian and financial needs. Tarhouni and Jibril noted that the TNC's financial needs increase as
more territory falls under rebel control; they are worried that, if they can't provide electricity to newly liberated towns
or fund other services there, disenchantment with the TNC will grow. Tarhouni agreed to reach out to the Indians to
discuss Libya's outstanding debts, to see if he can help us get India's hold on the frozen asset proposal lifted. Briefed on
South Africa's objections, fibril understood the need for continued outreach to Africa (although part of our South Africa
problem may derive from Jibril's poor relations with Zuma, with Jibril telling us that he recently accused Zuma of making
Nelson Mandela feel ashamed); Abdulrahman Shalgam will go to the August 25-26 AU Summit and Jibril did not rule out
attending himself. I've spoken several times to UAE Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed since arriving here, and the
UAE has finally responded positively to our soft collateral proposal for a loan to the TNC, which may be our fastest way
of getting funds here, assuming we can come up with a letter that meets the UAE's needs and passes the scrutiny of the
U.S. interagency process.
My traveling companions, Bill Roebuck (NEA/MAG director) and Ben Fishman from the NSS, start their return trip today.
I will go on to Cairo, Doha, and Abu Dhabi, where, inter alia, I will have more Libya discussions, including seeing Jibril
again in Doha. With NileSat continuing to broadcast Qadhafi's propaganda, the Libyan anger over Egypt's role
approaches if not exceeds annoyance with Qataar. We are also checking on how to get from Cairo back here, should I
need to join Chris here in the coming days.
Chris and his tiny staff are doing a heroic job in representing our interests here. I am especially appreciative to DS for all
the work done to support my trip. I also want to highlight the work that Pat Kennedy's M family and NEA/EX did in
establiishing living and working quarters for Chris and his team. Thanks to a lot of creativity and hard work, the

Re: Q's secret bid to UK
On the morning of June 2, 2011 sensitive sources with access to the advisors to Muammar
Qaddafi's son, Saif al-Islam, stated in strict confidence that the Libyan government has opened
extremely complicated negotiations with the government of the United Kingdom (UK) in an
effort to obtain their support in reaching a ceasefire agreement with the rebels of the Libyan
Transitional National Council (TNC), allowing the Qaddafi's to maintain some level of control
in the country.
This initiative is directed by Saif al-Islam and, according to these sensitive sources, the Libyans
have asked the UK officials to broker a deal with the TNC that will allow some form of power
sharing, with the possibility of Saif al-Islam acting as head of state and the TNC members
making up a substantial portion of the cabinet in a new government. Under the plan Muammar
Qaddafi would be allowed to leave the country and go into exile with no danger of indictment on
charges of human rights abuses and corruption by Libyan or international courts.
(Source Comment: In the opinion of these sensitive sources, this initiative reflects the concern of
the Qaddafi government that as a result of continuing NATO air raids against their forces, they
can no longer defeat the rebel army. They add that there has been no firm response from the UK
government, and the initial discussions have been conducted by officers of the British Special
Intelligence Service (SIS / MI-6). In the opinion of these same sources the initial idea of these
talks may have been raised by former Libyan Foreign Minister Mousa Kousa, after his arrival in
London in late March 2011.)
According to these sensitive sources, Saif al-Islam and his advisors realize that there is little
chance the TNC will agree to such an offer, and that SIS may be using this contact as a means of
collecting intelligence while protecting British interests in Libya. Notwithstanding this concern,
in the opinion of these individuals, Saif al-Islam believes that introducing the possibility of a
ceasefire and the subsequent negotiations may create divisions within NATO and weaken their
military operations against Qaddafi's forces.

Tibesti Hotel in the TNC capital of Benghazi. One person was injured in the blast and a number
of nearby vehicles were damaged. TNC security officers occupied the hotel and the surrounding
area immediately after the attack, but were not able to identif3r any of the attackers. The Tibesti
Hotel is an important landmark in the heart of Benghazi and is used by the TNC government, as
well by foreign journalists and diplomats. Hotel security has been heightened in the hours
following the attack and all foreign residents are under surveillance by TNC security officers,
looking for suspicious activities and contacts.

The father of Christopher Stevens, the U.S. ambassador to Libya who was killed in the attack in Benghazi last month, said
his son's death shouldn't be politicized in the presidential campaign.
""It would really be abhorrent to make this into a campaign issue,"" Jan Stevens, 77, said in a telephone interview from his
home in Loomis. California, as he prepares for a memorial service for his son next week.
Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee, has criticized President Barack ()barna for not providing adequate security in
Libya, saying the administration has left the country exposed to a deadly terrorist attack.
The ambassador's father, a lawyer, said politicians should await the findings of a formal investigation before making
accusations or judgments.
""The security matters are being adequately investigated,"" Stevens said. ""We don't pretend to be experts in security. It
has to be objectively examined. That's where it belongs. It does not belong in the campaign arena,"" Stevens said he has
been getting briefings from the State Department on the progress of the investigation.

'Very Optimistic'
Stevens said while he was dose with his son, ""we weren't that familiar with the day-to-day activities' he undertook in
Libya. On the occasions when his son called home, Stevens said, he didn't share many details about his work other than
to say that ""he was very optimistic about the results of the election and the new government."" They last spoke by phone
in August and by e-mail days before his son's death.
Stevens, a registered Democrat, said he isn't politically active. He declined to say how he'll vote in the presidential
election.
He said his son, who was a career diplomat and had worked for Republican and Democratic presidents, hadn't expressed
concerns to him about security or support from the administration. ""He felt very strongly about Secretary Clinton,""
Stevens said, referring to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. ""He felt she was an extremely able person.""
As for whether he had the tools and protection he needed for his job, Stevens said of his son: ""We didn't get into that""
sort of discussion. ""I never heard him say a critical word about the State Department or the administration, or any
administration for that matter, He came up through the foreign service, not politics.""
Obama Call
Stevens said neither of the two presidential campaigns reached out to him, and that he is grateful for that. He said
Obama telephoned him after his son's death to express his regrets and talk about identifying the perpetrators who
should be brought to justice, and that the conversation was in the context of his presidential duties and not political.
While polls indicate that voters say Obama would do a better job on foreign policy issues, Republicans see an
opportunity to cut into that advantage, pointing to surveys showing that voters have grown less satisfied since the Sept.
11 assault in Libya.
Stevens stopped short of directly criticizing either candidate.
""I'm not sure exactly what he's been saying and not saying, but our position is it would be a real shame if this were
politicized,"" Stevens said, referring to Romney. Our concern now is memorializing Chris and remembering his
contribution to the country.""
Campaign Shift
Romney's current foreign policy position marks a shift in tone from a campaign that has focused almost exclusively on
economic issues arid jobs.
The Romney team is attempting to link two campaign messages by charging Obama with weakening American interests
abroad at the same time as he's failed to boost the economy back home.
Speaking to voters on Oct. 12 in Richmond, Virginia, Romney chastised Vice President Joe Biden for his defense of the
administration's actions in the Libya attack.
""He's doubling down on denial, and we need to understand exactly what happened as opposed to just having people
brush this aside,"" Romney said.
During last week's vice presidential debate, Biden said the White House wasn't told of a request for additional security
at the mission in Benghazi the month before the incident.

State Department official Eric Nordstrom, who served as a regional security officer in Tripoli until July, told a
congressional committee that he was turned down when he requested an extension of a 16-member security support
team that was scheduled to leave Libya in August.
'Mission Creep'
Romney hasn't specified what he would do differently than the administration In Libya. In a speech at the Virginia
Military Institute earlier last week, he called for support of Libya's ""efforts to forge a lasting government"" and to pursue
the ""terrorists who attacked our consulate.""
That view is at odds with the position Romney took more than a year ago, when he opposed expanding the intervention
in Libya to capture Muammar Qaddafi, calling it ""mission creep and mission muddle"" in April 2011.
Neither the administration's initial public report that the attack began with a spontaneous demonstration against an
anti- Islamic video clip nor Republican suggestions that it was a planned attack tied to al-Qaeda are supported by U.S.
intelligence reports or by accounts of the night provided to a Bloomberg reporter by Benghazi residents.
White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters that ""the president wants to get to the bottom of what
happened.""
Carney also sought to minimize questions about why the president and other administration officials were slow to
publicly acknowledge the role of terrorism in the attack.
""As time went on, additional information became available,"" Carney said. ""Clearly, we know more today than we did on
the Sunday after the attack. But as the process moves forward and more information becomes available, we will be sure
to continue consulting with you.""

By any standard of reason, President Obama and Secretary of State Canton conducted themselves very well amid the
confusion and crises Of course they didn't do everything perfectly; for example, some unidentified administration official
disowned the embassy statement condemning the video. Such creepiness served only to make it look like Obama was
running for cover at the expense of our embattled diplomats. But minor miscues aside, Obama and Clinton nailed the
main points, especially Clinton. In her first statement soon after the riots, here s what she said The United States
deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of others. Our commitment to religious tolerance goes back
to the very beginning of our nation. But let me be clear There is never any justification for violent acts of this kind.""

The chief implementer of WPS at DOD also
traveled with me. It was extremely productive. SG Rasmussen chaired a meeting on 1325 today of all the NATO member
and partner ambassadors incl DaIcier. The new NATO special rep for 1325 -- the position sponsored by Norway and
approved at the Chicago summit â€” gave her inaugural address, and my DOD colleague and I discussed the US efforts
both generally and in Afghanistan. We were followed by extensive remarks from the NATO ambassadors, all of whom
touched on the importance of women's role in security and NATO's mission, as well as applauded US leadership. Many
mentioned you in their interventions! The ambs from Serbia, Azerbaijan and Georgia pointed to their own national
action plans (their existence was a surprise to us), as well as the new structures they have put in place to implement
them. The ambassador from Azerbaijan even said that he is hopeful women will contribute to ending their regional
conflict (I will tell Morningstar). The new special rep - a seasoned diplomat who knows her way around NATO --- wanted
me to ten you how much you have inspired her -- something I hear everywhere!
I'm confident our NATO visit also served to reinforce the importance of the NAP and the US role with our own people
both at NATO and DOD.
I was sorry to miss the discussion with ASSK but there are more events with her tomw. We are working hard on getting
the engagement of Burmese women into the formal peace structures being put in place to end the ethnic conflicts.
I also met with Vivian Redding at the EU who, despite her efforts, is unlikely to get a quota for women on public boards
of directors adopted. She too expressed her admiration of you and your leadership.
In addition to everything that's been said about Chris Stevens, he really understood the important role the women in
Libya were playing in peace and security. Whenever I met with Libyan women at meetings in the region, they went out
of their way to tell me how much he supported them and how much affection they had for him. Such an awful loss.
You've been magnificent throughout all this, despite how wrenching it's been.

Re: Q's secret bid to UK
On the morning of June 2, 2011 sensitive sources with access to the advisors to Muammar Qaddafi's son, Saif
al-Islam, stated in strict confidence that the Libyan government has opened extremely complicated negotiations
with the government of the United Kingdom (UK) in an effort to obtain their support in reaching a ceasefire
agreement with the rebels of the Libyan Transitional National Council (TNC), allowing the Qaddafi's to
maintain some level of control in the country.
This initiative is directed by Saif al-Islam and, according to these sensitive sources, the Libyans have asked the
UK officials to broker a deal with the TNC that will allow some form of power sharing, with the possibility of
Saif al-Islam acting as head of state and the TNC members making up a substantial portion of the cabinet in a
new government. Under the plan Muammar Qaddafi would be allowed to leave the country and go into exile
with no danger of indictment on charges of human rights abuses and corruption by Libyan or international
courts
(Source Comment: In the opinion of these sensitive sources, this initiative reflects the concern of the Qaddafi
government that as a result of continuing NATO air raids against their forces, they can no longer defeat the

rebel army. They add that there has been no firm response from the UK government, and the initial discussions
have been conducted by officers of the British Special Intelligence Service (SIS / In the opinion of these
same sources the initial idea of these talks may have been raised by former Libyan Foreign Minister Mousa
Kousa, after his arrival in London in late March 2011.)
According to these sensitive sources, Saif al-Islam and his advisors realize that there is little chance the TNC
will agree to such an offer, and that SIS may be using this contact as a means of collecting intelligence while
protecting British interests in Libya. Notwithstanding this concern, in the opinion of these individuals, Saif al-
Islam believes that introducing the possibility of a ceasefire and the subsequent negotiations may create
divisions within NATO and weaken their military operations against Qaddafi's forces.
(Source Comment. These sources add that many of Saif al-Islam's advisors do not know if, or to what extent,
the UK Government has shared knowledge of this initiative with the governments of the United States and the
other NATO allies.)
At the same time, sources with access to the operations of the TNC military committee state privately that on
June 1, 2011 Libyan intelligence officers detonated a car bomb outside the Tibesti Hotel in the TNC capital of
Benghazi. One person was injured in the blast and a number of nearby vehicles were damaged. TNC security
officers occupied the hotel and the surrounding area immediately after the attack, but were not able to identify
any of the attackers. The Tibesti Hotel is an important landmark in the heart of Benghazi and is used by the
INC government, as well by foreign journalists and diplomats. Hotel security has been heightened in the hours
following the attack and all foreign residents are under surveillance by TNC security officers, looking for
suspicious activities and contacts.

Dear Mr. Sullivan,
As per your request, here is the transcript from Ambassador Rice's appearance on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" We will
forward the transcripts from the other Sunday morning shows as we receive them. Thank you
Announcer: From NBC News in Washington, MEET THE PRESS with David Gregory.
GREGORY: And good morning. Relative calm this morning in the Middle East after several days of
intense anti-American protests raged across many parts of the Islamic world. But word this morning
that the Obama administration has ordered the evacuation of all but emergency personnel from
diplomatic missions in Tunisia and Sudan. And defense secretary Leon Panetta saying this morning,
the Pentagon has deployed forces to several areas in an increased effort to protect U.S. personnel
and property from the potential of violent protests, the latest consequences, of course, of this
troubling unrest. Joining me now for the very latest, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations,
Susan Rice. Ambassador Rice, welcome back to MEET THE PRESS.
MS. SUSAN RICE (U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations): Thank you, good to be here.
GREGORY: The images as you well know are jarring to Americans watching all of this play out this
week, and we'll share the map of all of this turmoil with our viewers to show the scale of it across not
just the Arab world, but the entire Islamic world and flashpoints as well. In Egypt, of course, the
protests outside the U.S. embassy there that Egyptian officials were slow to put down. This weekend
in Pakistan, protests as well there. More anti-American rage. Also protests against the drone
strikes. In Yemen, you also had arrests and some deaths outside of our U.S. embassy there. How
much longer can Americans expect to see these troubling images and these protests go forward?

MS. RICE: Well, David, we can't predict with any certainty. But let's remember what has transpired
over the last several days. This is a response to a hateful and offensive video that was widely
disseminated throughout the Arab and Muslim world. Obviously, our view is that there is absolutely
no excuse for violence and that-- what has happened is condemnable, but this is a-- a spontaneous
reaction to a video, and it's not dissimilar but, perhaps, on a slightly larger scale than what we have
seen in the past with The Satanic Verses with the cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad. Now, the
United States has made very clear and the president has been very plain that our top priority is the
protection of American personnel in our facilities and bringing to justice those who...
GREGORY: All right.
MS. RICE: . attacked our facility in Benghazi.
GREGORY: Well, let's talkâ€” talk about-- well, you talked about this as spontaneous. Can you say
definitively that the attacks on-- on our consulate in Libya that killed ambassador Stevens and others
there security personnel, that was spontaneous, was it a planned attack? Was there a terrorist
element to it?
MS. RICE: Well, let us-- let me tell you the-- the best information we have at present. First of all,
there's an FBI investigation which is ongoing. And we look to that investigation to give us the
definitive word as to what transpired. But putting together the best information that we have available
to us today our current assessment is that what happened in Benghazi was in fact initially a
spontaneous reaction to what had just transpired hours before in Cairo, almost a copycat of-- of the
demonstrations against our facility in Cairo, which were prompted, of course, by the video. What we
think then transpired in Benghazi is that opportunistic extremist elements came to the consulate as
this was unfolding. They came with heavy weapons which unfortunately are readily available in post
revolutionary Libya, And it escalated into a much more violent episode. Obviously, that's-- that's our
best judgment now. We'll await the results of the investigation. And the president has been very
clear--we'll work with the Libyan authorities to bring those responsible to justice.
GREGORY: Was there a failure here that this administration is responsible for, whether it's an
intelligence failure, a failure to see this coming, or a failure to adequately protect U.S. embassies and
installations from a spontaneous kind of reaction like this?
MS. RICE: David, I don't think so. First of all we had no actionable intelligence to suggest that-- that
any attack on our facility in Benghazi was imminent. In Cairo, we did have indications that there was
the risk that the video might spark some-- some protests and our embassy, in fact, acted accordingly,
and had called upon the Egyptian authorities toâ€” to reinforce our fasility. What we have seen as--
with respect to the security response, obviously we had security personnel in Benghazi, a-- a

significant number, and tragically, among those four that were killed were two of our security
personnel. But what happened, obviously, overwhelmed the security we had in place which is why
the president ordered additional reinforcements to Tripoli andâ€” and why elsewhere in the world we
have been working with governments to ensure they take up their obligations to protect us and we
reinforce where necessary.
GREGORY: The president and the secretary of state have talked about a mob mentality. That's my
words, not their words, but they talked about the-- the tyranny of mobs operating in this part of the
world. Here's the reality, if you look at foreign aid--U.S. direct foreign aid to the two countries
involved here, in Libya and Egypt, this is what you'd see: two hundred million since 2011 to Libya,
over a billion a year to Egypt and yet Americans are seeing these kinds of protests and attacks on our
own diplomats. Would-- what do you say to members of congress who are now weighing whether to
suspend our aid to these countries if this is the response that America gets?
MS. RICE: Well, first of all, David, let's put this in perspective. As I said, this is a response to aâ€” a
very offensive video. It's not the first time that American facilities have come under attack in the
Middle East, going back to 1982 in-- in Beirut, going back to the Khobar Towers in-- in Saudi Arabia,
or even the attack on our embassy in 2008 in Yemen.
GREGORY: Or Iran in 1979.
MS. RICE: This has-- this has happened in the past, but there-- and so I don't think that-- that we
should misunderstand what this is. The reason we provide aid in Egypt and in Libya is because it
serves American interests because the relationships...
GREGORY: But-- but our Americans are not being served if this is the response.
MS. RICE: It serves our interests to have Egypt willing and able to-- to maintain its peace treaty with
Israel, it servers our interest for Egypt to continue to be a strong partner. Now, let's be clear, the
government, once President Obama called President Morsi, immediately in Egypt the security forces
came out and have provided very significant protection. Same in Tunisia, same in Libya, same in
Yemen. And all of these leaders have very forcefully conveyed their condemnation of what has
transpired.
GREGORY: But there were conflicting messages from the Morsi government. In Arabic they
encourage protests, in English they said stop the protests. This from an ally that we give over a
billion dollars?

MS. RICE: What has happened in fact is that the Egyptian government has come out and protected
our facilities. Our embassy is open today, things are calm. And Morsi has repeatedly been clear in
his condemnation of-- of what has occurred. We-- we are in these partnerships, David, over the long-
term. We think that-- that-- despite this very bumpy path we're on and the very disturbing images
we've seen, it's in the United States fundamental interest that people have the ability to choose their
own governments, that the governments be democratic and free. That's in our long-term best
interest.
GREGORY: You know that this...
MS. RICE: We need to reinforce that with our assistance.
GREGORY: We are in the middle of a heated presidential campaign, there are different foreign
policy visions. That's why we wanted to dedicate the hour to this today to really understand these
different views. Mitt Romney spoke out this week, he criticized the administration, talked about
whether the United States was apologizing for some of the initial response to this. These were his
comments this week.
(Videotape; Wednesday)
MR. MITT ROMNEY: The administration was wrong to stand by a statement sympathizing with those
who had breached our embassy in Egypt instead of condemning their actions. I think it's aâ€” a-- a
terrible course to-- for America to-- to stand in apology for our values.
(End videotape)
GREGORY: Our embassies did not stand up for speech-- free speech in this initial response to this
violence. And the Republican charge is that it's weakness on the part of this administration that
invites this kind of chaos, that the administration has not been tough enough on radical extremists
that are beginning to take root in these countries. How do you respond to that?
MS. RICE: First of all, I think the American people and certainly our diplomats and-- and
development experts who are putting their lives on the line around the world every day expect from
our leadership unity in times of challenge and strong, steady, steadfast leadership of the sort that
President Obama has been providing. With respect to this, I think, vacuous charge of weakness,
let's-- lets recall, I think, the American people fully understand that this is an administration led by a
president who said when he ran for office that he would take the fight to al Qaeda. We have
decimated al Qaeda. Â°same bin Laden is dead. He said we would end the war responsibly in
Iraq. We've done that. He has restored relationships around the world. I spend every day up at the
United Nations where I have to interact with 192 other countries. I know how well the United States is

viewed. I know that our standing is much improved and it's translated into important support for
strong American positions, for example with sanctions against Iran.
GREGORY: Was it inappropriate for Governor Romney to level the criticism he leveled?
MS. RICE: I'm not going to get into politics, David. That's not my role in this job. But I think the
American people welcome and appreciate strong, steady, unified leadership, bipartisan in times of
challenge. And for those men and women in our diplomatic service, including those we tragically lost,
they look to our leadership to be unified and responsible.
GREGORY: Let's talk about another area where the administration is on the defensive in terms of
leadership in the world, and that is the nuclear threat from Iran. Another area of tension between the
United States and Israel. In just a couple of minutes we will show our interview with the prime
minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu. And our viewers will see that. One aspect is how close Iran
is getting to becoming a nuclear power. I asked him about that. I want to show you a piece of the
interview and get your reaction to it.
(Videotape)
PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU (Prime Minister of Israel): I can tell you, David, that Iran
has been placed with some clear red lines on a few matters, and they have avoided crossing
them. So I think that as they get closer and closer and closer to the achievement of the weapons-
grade material, and they're very close, they're six months away from being about 90 percent of
having the enriched uranium for an atom bomb, I think that you have to place that red line before
them now, before it's-- it's too late.
GREGORY: As the prime minister of Israel, has Iran crossed your red line?
MR. NETANYAHU: Well, the way I would say it, David, is they are in the red zone. You know, they
are in the last 20 yards. And you can't let them cross that goal line. You can't let them score a
touchdown, because that would have unbelievable consequences, grievous consequences, for the
peace and security of us all-- of the world really.
(End videotape)
GREGORY: What is President Obama's line in the sand, the point at which he says to Iran don't
cross this with your nuclear program or there's going to be a military consequence?

MS. RICE: David, the president has been very, very clear. Our bottom line, if you want to call it a red
line, president's bottom line has been that Iran will not acquire a nuclear weapon and we will take no
option off the table to ensure that it does not acquire a nuclear weapon, including the military option.
GREGORY: The prime minister says_.
MS. RICE: But...
GREGORY: ...they are acquiring.
MS. RICE: ...he's talking about a-- a red zone which is a new concept...
GREGORY: No, no, but he's talking about how close they are to actually becoming a nuclear power--
having to develop a capacity to become a nuclear power.
MS. RICE: They're not there yet. They are not there yet. And our assessment is, and-- and we
share this regularly with our Israeli counterparts in the intelligence and defense community, that there
is time and space for the pressure we are mounting, which is unprecedented in terms of sanctions, to
still yield results. This is not imminent. The window is not infinite, but let's be clear--the sanctions
that-- that are now in place reached their high point in July. The-- the Iranian economy is
suffering. It's shrinking for the first time. Negative one percent growth. The amount of production of
Iranian oil has dropped 40 percent over the last several months. Their currency has plummeted 40
percent over the last several months. This pressure is even to use the Iranian's own words crippling.
GREGORY: But can you say...
MS. RICE: And we think...
GREGORY: ...that President Obama's strategy to keep Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon almost
at the end of his first term is succeeding or failing?
MS. RICE: David, what is clear is Iran does not have a nuclear weapon. And that Iran is more
isolated than ever internationally. The economic pressure it is facing is much greater than
ever. When President Obama came to office the international community was divided about
Iran. And Iran was internally very united. The exact opposite is the case today. The international
community is united. We just had another strong resolution out of the IAEA Board of Governors. And
the internal dynamics in Iran are-- are fracturing and the leadership is divided. We are committed and
President Obama is committed to preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. It is not a policy
of containment. But, David, the most difficult and profound decision that any president has to make is

the decision to go to war. And this president is committed to exhausting pressure, economic
pressure, and diplomacy while there is-- is still time before making a decision of such consequence.
GREGORY: Ambassador Rice, the debate continues. Thank you very much...
MS. RICE: Thank you.
GREGORY: ...for your views this morning.
Now to this looming nuclear threat from Iran from the Israeli perspective. There were new tensions
between the Obama administration in Israel this week. Earlier, I spoke with the prime minister of

outcome of our presidential campaign.

Subject: 'State of the Union' Transcript: U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice
Dear Mr. Sullivan,
As per your request, here is the transcript from Ambassador Rice's appearance on CNN's ""State of the Union."" We will
forward the transcripts from the other Sunday morning shows as we receive them. Thank you.
CROWLEY: Joining me is the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Susan Rice.
Madam Ambassador, thank you for joining us.
RICE: Good to be with you, Candy.
CROWLEY: One of the things when I spoke with the Israeli prime minister that struck me was the conviction that he has
that for certain Iran is building on its way to building a nuclear weapon, and his sense of urgency that at this moment
the U.S. needs to set what he calls a ""red line"" for the U.S.
Does the U.S. share the conviction that Iran is, indeed, building a nuclear weapon? And, B, what about the concept of a
red line?
RICE: Well, Candy, the United States is in constant communication with Israel and Israeli intelligence, Israeli policy
makers, the military. We're sharing our assessments every day. And our assessments, our intelligence assessments are
very similar. Obviously, we share a grave concern about Iran pursuing a nuclear weapon. We are determined to prevent
that from happening. President Obama has been absolutely clear, and on this there's absolutely no daylight between the
United States and Israel that we will do what it takes to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.
We are not at that stage yet. They do not have a nuclear weapon. Our shared intelligence assessments is that there is
still a considerable time and space before they will have a nuclear weapon should they make the decision to go for that.
But we've been very clear. The United States is not interested and is not pursuing a policy of containment. President
Obama has been very plain. We will keep all option on the table, including the military option, as necessary, to prevent
Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.
But, Candy, the fact is we have just seen the imposition of another layer of the toughest sanctions that have ever been
impose Odd a country. In this case, Iran. Their economy is beginning to buckle. Their oil production is down 40 percent.
Their currency has plummeted 40 percent in the last year. Their economy is now shrinking. And this is only going to
intensify.

So we think that there's still considerable time for this pressure to work. But this is not an infinite window. And we've
made very clear that the president's bottom line is Iran will not have a nuclear weapon.
CROWLEY: Let me move you to what's gone on in the Middle East in Arab countries and elsewhere. There is a ""New York
Times"" story this morning that suggests that the administration thinks this is a foreshadowing of a fall that will see
sustained instability. Does the administration expect to see these sorts of protests outside U.S. embassies and elsewhere
throughout the fall?
RICE: Well, Candy, first of all, let's recall what has happened in the last several days. There was a hateful video that was
disseminated on the Internet. It had nothing to do with the United States government and it's one that we find
disgusting and reprehensible. It's been offensive to many, many people around the world.
That sparked violence in various parts of the world, including violence directed against western facilities including our
embassies and consulates. That violence is absolutely unacceptable, it's not a response that one can ever condone when
it comes to such a video. And we have been working very closely and, indeed, effectively with the governments in the
region and around the world to secure our personnel, secure our embassy, condemn the violent response to this video.
And, frankly, we've seen these sorts of incidents in the past. We've seen violent responses to ""Satanic Verses."" We've
seen violent responses to the cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammed in an evil way. So this is something we've seen
in the past, and we expect that it's possible that these kinds of things could percolate into the future. What we're
focused on is securing our personnel, securing our facilities.
CROWLEY: Do you at this moment feel that U.S. embassies abroad are secure?
RICE: We are doing our utmost to secure our facilities and our personnel and in various vulnerable places. We have
demanded and we are receiving the cooperation of host governments. Host governments have also put out very strong
messages in Libya, in Egypt, in Yemen and Tunisia condemning violence, saying that it's a completely unacceptable
response to such a video. And we feel that we are now in a position doing the maximum that we can to protect our
people.
CROWLEY: Why would one not look at what is going on in the Middle East now and say that the president's outreach to
Muslims, which began at the beginning of his administration in Cairo and elsewhere has not worked because, yes, this
video sparked it, but there is an underlying anti-Americanism that is very evident on the streets. So Why not look at it
and think that this is this outreach has failed?
RICE: For the same reason, Candy, when you look back at history and we had the horrible experience of our facilities and
our personnel being attacked Beirut in 1981, we had the attack on Khobar Towers in the 1990s. We had an attack on our
embassy in Yemen in 2008. There have been such attacks. There have been expressions of hostility towards the west.
CROWLEY: But this was sort of a reset, was it not? It was supposed to be a reset of U.S.-Muslim relations?
RICE: And indeed, in fact, there had been substantial improvements. I have been to Libya and walked the streets of
Benghazi myself. And despite what we saw in that horrific incident where some mob was hijacked ultimately by a
handful of extremists, the United States is extremely popular in Libya and the outpouring of sympathy and support for
Ambassador Stevens and his colleagues from the government, from people is evidence of that.
The fact is, Candy, that this is a turbulent time. It's a time of dramatic change. It's a change that the United States has
backed because we understand that when democracy takes root, when human rights and people's freedom of
expression can be manifested, it may lead to turbulence in the short-term, but over the long-term, that is in the interest
of the United States.
The mobs we've seen on the outside of these embassies are small minority. They're the ones who have largely lost in

going to continue to stand with the vast majority of the populations in these countries.

The father of Christopher Stevens, the U.S. ambassador to Libya who was killed in the attack in Benghazi last month, said
his son's death shouldn't be politicized in the presidential campaign.
""It would really be abhorrent to make this into a campaign issue,"" Jan Stevens, 77, said in a telephone interview from his
home in Loomis, California, as he prepares for a memorial service for his son next week.
Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee, has criticized President Barack Obama for not providing adequate security in
Libya, saying the administration has left the country exposed to a deadly terrorist attack.
The ambassador's father, a lawyer, said politicians should await the findings of a formal investigation before making
accusations or judgments.
""The security matters are being adequately investigated,"" Stevens said. ""We don't pretend to be experts in security. It
has to be objectively examined. That's where it belongs. It does not belong in the campaign arena.' Stevens said he has
been getting briefings from the State Department on the progress of the investigation.
'Very Optimistic'
Stevens said while he was close with his son, ""we weren't that familiar with the day-to-day activities"" he undertook in
Libya. On the occasions when his son called home, Stevens said, he didn't share many details about his work other than
to say that ""he was very optimistic about the results of the election and the new government."" They last spoke by phone
in August and by e-mail days before his son's death.
Stevens, a registered Democrat, said he isn't politically active. He declined to say how he'll vote in the presidential
election.
He said his son, who was a career diplomat and had worked for Republican and Democratic presidents, hadn't expressed
concerns to him about security or support from the administration. ""He felt very strongly about Secretary Clinton,""
Stevens said, referring to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. ""He felt she was an extremely able person.""
As for whether he had the tools and protection he needed for his job, Stevens said of his son: ""We didn't get into that""
sort of discussion. ""I never heard him say a critical word about the State Department or the administration, or any
administration for that matter. He came up through the foreign service, not politics.""
Obama Call
Stevens said neither of the two presidential campaigns reached out to him, and that he is grateful for that. He said
Obama telephoned him after his son's death to express his regrets and talk about identifying the perpetrators who
should be brought to justice, and that the conversation was in the context of his presidential duties and not political.
While polls indicate that voters say Obama would do a better job on foreign policy issues, Republicans see an
opportunity to cut into that advantage, pointing to surveys showing that voters have grown less satisfied since the Sept.
11 assault in Libya.
Stevens stopped short of directly criticizing either candidate.
""I'm not sure exactly what he's been saying and not saying, but our position is it would be a real shame if this were
politicized,"" Stevens said, referring to Romney. ""Our concern now is memorializing Chris and remembering his
contribution to the country.""

Romney's current foreign policy position marks a shift in tone from a campaign that has focused almost exclusively on
economic issues and jobs.
The Romney team is attempting to link two campaign messages by charging Obama with weakening American interests
abroad at the same time as he's failed to boost the economy back home.
Speaking to voters on Oct. 12 in Richmond, Virginia, Romney chastised Vice President Joe Biden for his defense of the
administration's actions in the Libya attack.
""He's doubling down on denial, and we need to understand exactly what happened as opposed to just having people
brush this aside,"" Romney said.
During last week's vice presidential debate, Biden said the White House wasn't told of a request for additional security
at the mission in Benghazi the month before the incident.
State Department official Eric Nordstrom, who served as a regional security officer in Tripoli until July, told a
congressional committee that he was turned down when he requested an extension of a 16-member security support
team that was scheduled to leave Libya in August.
'Mission Creep'
Romney hasn't specified what he would do differently than the administration in Libya. In a speech at the Virginia
Military Institute earlier last week, he called for support of Libya's ""efforts to forge a lasting government"" and to pursue
the ""terrorists who attacked our consulate.""
That view is at odds with the position Romney took more than a year ago, when he opposed expanding the intervention
in Libya to capture Muammar Qaddafi, calling it ""mission creep and mission muddle"" in April 2011.
Neither the administration's initial public report that the attack began with a spontaneous demonstration against an
anti- Islamic video clip nor Republican suggestions that it was a planned attack tied to al-Qaeda are supported by U.S.
intelligence reports or by accounts of the night provided to a Bloomberg reporter by Benghazi residents.
White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters that ""the president wants to get to the bottom of what
happened.""
Carney also sought to minimize questions about why the president and other administration officials were slow to
publicly acknowledge the role of terrorism in the attack.
""As time went on, additional information became available,"" Carney said. ""Clearly, we know more today than we did on
the Sunday after the attack. But as the process moves forward and more information becomes available, we will be sure
to continue consulting with you.""

Re: Q's secret bid to UK
On the morning of June 2, 2011 sensitive sources with access to the advisors to Muammar Qaddafi's son, Saif
al-Islam, stated in strict confidence that the Libyan government has opened extremely complicated negotiations
with the government of the United Kingdom (UK) in an effort to obtain their support in reaching a ceasefire
agreement with the rebels of the Libyan Transitional National Council (TNC), allowing the Qaddafi's to
maintain some level of control in the country.
This initiative is directed by Saif al-Islam and, according to these sensitive sources, the Libyans have asked the
UK officials to broker a deal with the `INC that will allow some form of power sharing, with the possibility of
Saif al-Islam acting as head of state and the TNC members making up a substantial portion of the cabinet in a

new government. Under the plan Muammar Qadde would be allowed to leave the country and go into exile
with no danger of indictment on charges of human rights abuses and corruption by Libyan or international
courts.
(Source Comment: In the opinion of these sensitive sources, this initiative reflects the concern of the Qa.ddafi
government that as a result of continuing NATO air raids against their forces, they can no longer defeat the
rebel army. They add that there has been no firm response from the UK government, and the initial discussions
have been conducted by officers of the British Special Intelligence Service (SIS M1-6). In the opinion of these
same sources the initial idea of these talks may have been raised by former Libyan Foreign Minister Mouse
Kousa, after his arrival in London in late March 2011.)
According to these sensitive sources, Saif al-Islam and his advisors realize that there is little chance the TNC
will agree to such an offer, and that SIS may be using this contact as a means of collecting intelligence while
protecting British interests in Libya. Notwithstanding this concern, in the opinion of these individuals, Saif al-
Islam believes that introducing the possibility of a ceasefire and the subsequent negotiations may create
divisions within NATO and weaken their military operations against Qaddaft's forces.
(Source Comment: These sources add that many of Sail al-Islam's advisors do not know if, or to what extent,
the UK Government has shared knowledge of this initiative with the governments of the United States and the
other NATO allies.)
At the same time, sources with access to the operations of the INC military committee state privately that on
June 1, 2011 Libyan intelligence officers detonated a car bomb outside the Tibesti Hotel in the INC capital of
Benghazi. One person was injured in the blast and a number of nearby vehicles were damaged. INC security
officers occupied the hotel and the surrounding area immediately after the attack, but were not able to identify
any of the attackers. The Tibesti Hotel is an important landmark in the heart of Benghazi and 'is used by the
INC government, as well by foreign journalists and diplomats. Hotel security has been heightened in the hours
following the attack and all foreign residents are under surveillance by INC security officers, looking for
suspicious activities and contacts.

Dear Mr. Sullivan,
As per your request, here is the transcript from Ambassador Rice's appearance on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" We will
forward the transcripts from the other Sunday morning shows as we receive them. Thank you.
Announcer: From NBC News in Washington, MEET THE PRESS with David Gregory.
GREGORY: And good morning. Relative calm this morning in the Middle East after several days of
intense anti-American protests raged across many parts of the Islamic world. But word this morning
that the Obama administration has ordered the evacuation of all but emergency personnel from
diplomatic missions in Tunisia and Sudan. And defense secretary Leon Panetta saying this morning,
the Pentagon has deployed forces to several areas in an increased effort to protect U.S. personnel
and property from the potential of violent protests, the latest consequences, of course, of this
troubling unrest. Joining me now for the very latest, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations,
Susan Rice. Ambassador Rice, welcome back to MEET THE PRESS.
MS. SUSAN RICE (U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations): Thank you, good to be here.
GREGORY: The images as you well know are jarring to Americans watching all of this play out this
week, and we'll share the map of all of this turmoil with our viewers to show the scale of it across not
just the Arab world, but the entire Islamic world and flashpoints as well. In Egypt, of course, the

protests outside the U.S. embassy there that Egyptian officials were slow to put down. This weekend
in Pakistan, protests as well there. More anti-American rage. Also protests against the drone
strikes. In Yemen, you also had arrests and some deaths outside of our U.S. embassy there. How
much longer can Americans expect to see these troubling images and these protests go forward?
MS. RICE: Well, David, we can't predict with any certainty. But let's remember what has transpired
over the last several days. This is a response to a hateful and offensive video that was widely
disseminated throughout the Arab and Muslim world. Obviously, our view is that there is absolutely
no excuse for violence and that-- what has happened is condemnable, but this is a-- a spontaneous
reaction to a video, and it's not dissimilar but, perhaps, on a slightly larger scale than what we have
seen in the past with The Satanic Verses with the cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad. Now, the
United States has made very clear and the president has been very plain that our top priority is the
protection of American personnel in our facilities and bringing to justice those who...
GREGORY: All right.
MS RICE: ...attacked our facility in Benghazi.
GREGORY: Well, let's talk-- talk about-- well, you talked about this as spontaneous. Can you say
definitively that the attacks on-- on our consulate in Libya that killed ambassador Stevens and others
there security personnel, that was spontaneous, was it a planned attack? Was there a terrorist
element to it?
MS. RICE: Well, let us-- let me tell you the-- the best information we have at present. First of all,
there's an FBI investigation which is ongoing. And we look to that investigation to give us the
definitive word as to what transpired. But putting together the best information that we have available
to us today our current assessment is that what happened in Benghazi was in fact initially a
spontaneous reaction to what had just transpired hours before in Cairo, almost a copycat of-- of the
demonstrations against our facility in Cairo, which were prompted, of course, by the video. What we
think then transpired in Benghazi is that opportunistic extremist elements came to the consulate as
this was unfolding. They came with heavy weapons which unfortunately are readily available in post
revolutionary Libya. And it escalated into a much more violent episode. Obviously, that's-- that's our
best judgment now. We'll await the results of the investigation. And the president has been very
clear--we'll work with the Libyan authorities to bring those responsible to justice.
GREGORY: Was there a failure here that this administration is responsible for, whether it's an
intelligence failure, a failure to see this coming, or a failure to adequately protect U.S. embassies and
installations from a spontaneous kind of reaction like this?

MS. RICE: David, I don't think so. First of all we had no actionable intelligence to suggest that-- that
any attack on our facility in Benghazi was imminent. In Cairo, we did have indications that there was
the risk that the video might spark someâ€” some protests and our embassy, in fact, acted accordingly,
and had called upon the Egyptian authorities to-- to reinforce our facility. What we have seen as--
with respect to the security response, obviously we had security personnel in Benghazi, a-- a
significant number, and tragically, among those four that were killed were two of our security
personnel. But what happened, obviously, overwhelmed the security we had in place which is why
the president ordered additional reinforcements to Tripoli and-- and why elsewhere in the world we
have been working with governments to ensure they take up their obligations to protect us and we
reinforce where necessary.
GREGORY: The president and the secretary of state have talked about a mob mentality. That's my
words, not their words, but they talked about theâ€” the tyranny of mobs operating in this part of the
world. Here's the reality, if you look at foreign aid--U.S. direct foreign aid to the two countries
involved here, in Libya and Egypt, this is what you'd see: two hundred million since 2011 to Libya,
over a billion a year to Egypt and yet Americans are seeing these kinds of protests and attacks on our
own diplomats. Would-- what do you say to members of congress who are now weighing whether to
suspend our aid to these countries if this is the response that America gets?
MS. RICE: Well, first of all. David, let's put this in perspective. As I said, this is a response to a-- a
very offensive video. It's not the first time that American facilities have come under attack in the
Middle East, going back to 1982 in-- in Beirut, going back to the Khobar Towers in-- in Saudi Arabia,
or even the attack on our embassy in 2008 in Yemen.
GREGORY: Or Iran in 1979.
MS. RICE: This has-- this has happened in the past, but there-- and so I don't think that-- that we
should misunderstand what this is. The reason we provide aid in Egypt and in Libya is because it
serves American interests because the relationships...
GREGORY: Butâ€” but our Americans are not being served if this is the response.
MS. RICE: It serves our interests to have Egypt willing and able toâ€” to maintain its peace treaty with
Israel, it servers our interest for Egypt to continue to be a strong partner. Now, let's be clear, the
government, once President Obama called President Morsi, immediately in Egypt the security forces
came out and have provided very significant protection. Same in Tunisia, same in Libya, same in
Yemen. And all of these leaders have very forcefully conveyed their condemnation of what has
transpired.

GREGORY: But there were conflicting messages from the Morsi government. In Arabic they
encourage protests, in English they said stop the protests. This from an ally that we give over a
billion dollars?
MS. RICE: What has happened in fact is that the Egyptian government has come out and protected
our facilities. Our embassy is open today, things are calm. And Morsi has repeatedly been clear in
his condemnation of-- of what has occurred. We-- we are in these partnerships, David, over the long-
term. We think that-- thatâ€” despite this very bumpy path we're on and the very disturbing images
we've seen, it's in the United States fundamental interest that people have the ability to choose their
own governments, that the governments be democratic and free. That's in our long-term best
interest.
GREGORY: You know that thisâ€ž.
MS. RICE: We need to reinforce that with our assistance.
GREGORY: We are in the middle of a heated presidential campaign, there are different foreign
policy visions. That's why we wanted to dedicate the hour to this today to really understand these
different views, Mitt Romney spoke out this week, he criticized the administration, talked about
whether the United States was apologizing for some of the initial response to this. These were his
comments this week.
(Videotape; Wednesday)
MR. MITT ROMNEY: The administration was wrong to stand by a statement sympathizing with those
who had breached our embassy in Egypt instead of condemning their actions. I think it's a-- a-- a
terrible course to-- for America to-- to stand in apology for our values.
(End videotape)
GREGORY: Our embassies did not stand up for speechâ€” free speech in this initial response to this
violence. And the Republican charge is that it's weakness on the part of this administration that
invites this kind of chaos, that the administration has not been tough enough on radical extremists
that are beginning to take root in these countries. How do you respond to that
MS. RICE: First of all, I think the American people and certainly our diplomats and-- and
development experts who are putting their lives on the line around the world every day expect from
our leadership unity in times of challenge and strong, steady, steadfast leadership of the sort that
President Obama has been providing. With respect to this, I think, vacuous charge of weakness,

letsâ€” lets recall, I think, the American people fully understand that this is an administration led by a
president who said when he ran for office that he would take the fight to at Qaeda. We have
decimated at Qaeda. Osama bin Laden is dead. He said we would end the war responsibly in
Iraq. We've done that. He has restored relationships around the world. I spend every day up at the
United Nations where I have to interact with 192 other countries. I know how well the United States is
viewed. I know that our standing is much improved and it's translated into important support for
strong American positions, for example with sanctions against Iran.
GREGORY: Was it inappropriate for Governor Romney to level the criticism he leveled?
MS. RICE: I'm not going to get into politics, David. That's not my role in this job. But I think the
American people welcome and appreciate strong, steady, unified leadership, bipartisan in times of
challenge. And for those men and women in our diplomatic service, including those we tragically lost,
they look to our leadership to be unified and responsible.
GREGORY: Let's talk about another area where the administration is on the defensive in terms of
leadership in the world, and that is the nuclear threat from Iran. Another area of tension between the
United States and Israel. In just a couple of minutes we will show our interview with the prime
minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu. And our viewers will see that. One aspect is how close Iran
is getting to becoming a nuclear power. I asked him about that. I want to show you a piece of the
interview and get your reaction to it.
(Videotape)
PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU (Prime Minister of Israel): I can tell you, David, that Iran
has been placed with some clear red lines on a few matters, and they have avoided crossing
them. So I think that as they get closer and closer and closer to the achievement of the weapons-
grade material, and they're very close, they're six months away from being about 90 percent of
having the enriched uranium for an atom bomb, I think that you have to place that red line before
them now, before it'sâ€” it's too late.
GREGORY: As the prime minister of Israel, has Iran crossed your red line?
MR. NETANYAHU: Well, the way I would say it, David, is they are in the red zone. You know, they
are in the last 20 yards. And you can't let them cross that goal line. You can't let them score a
touchdown, because that would have unbelievable consequences, grievous consequences, for the
peace and security of us all-- of the world really.

GREGORY: What is President Obama's line in the sand, the point at which he says to Iran don't
cross this with your nuclear program or there's going to be a military consequence?
MS. RICE David, the president has been very, very clear. Our bottom line, if you want to call it a red
line, president's bottom line has been that Iran will not acquire a nuclear weapon and we will take no
option off the table to ensure that it does not acquire a nuclear weapon, including the military option.
GREGORY: The prime minister says...
MS. RICE: But...
GREGORY: ...they are acquiring.
MS. RICE: ...he's talking about a-- a red zone which is a new concept...
GREGORY: No, no, but he's talking about how close they are to actually becoming a nuclear power--
having to develop a capacity to become a nuclear power.
MS. RICE: They're not there yet. They are not there yet. And our assessment is, and-- and we
share this regularly with our Israeli counterparts in the intelligence and defense community, that there
is time and space for the pressure we are mounting, which is unprecedented in terms of sanctions, to
still yield results. This is not imminent. The window is not infinite, but let's be clearâ€”the sanctions
thatâ€” that are now in place reached their high point in July. The-- the Iranian economy is
suffering. It's shrinking for the first time. Negative one percent growth. The amount of production of
Iranian oil has dropped 40 percent over the last several months. Their currency has plummeted 40
percent over the last several months. This pressure is even to use the Iranian's own words crippling.
GREGORY: But can you say...
MS. RICE: And we think...
GREGORY: ...that President Obama's strategy to keep Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon almost
at the end of his first term is succeeding or failing?
MS. RICE: David, what is clear is Iran does not have a nuclear weapon. And that Iran is more
isolated than ever internationally. The economic pressure it is facing is much greater than
ever. When President Obama came to office the international community was divided about
Iran. And Iran was internally very united. The exact opposite is the case today. The international
community is united. We just had another strong resolution out of the IAEA Board of Governors. And

the internal dynamics in Iran are-- are fracturing and the leadership is divided. We are committed and
President Obama is committed to preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. It is not a policy
of containment. But, David; the most difficult and profound decision that any president has to make is
the decision to go to war. And this president is committed to exhausting pressure, economic
pressure, and diplomacy while there isâ€” is still time before making a decision of such consequence.
GREGORY: Ambassador Rice, the debate continues. Thank you very much...
MS. RICE: Thank you.
GREGORY: ...for your views this morning.
Now to this looming nuclear threat from Iran from the Israeli perspective, There were new tensions
between the Â°barna administration in Israel this week. Earlier, I spoke with the prime minister of

outcome of our presidential campaign.

Re: Who killed Younis
SOURCE: Sources with access to the Libyan Transitional National Council as well as Western Intelligence and security
services.
During the morning of August 5, 2011 sources with direct access to senior levels of the Libyan Transnational Council
(INC) stated in strictest confidence that the rebel military commander, General Atadel Fatah Younis was executed by
security forces on orders from TNC Chairman Mustapha Jai. According to these sources, in late July 2011 INC security
officers received what they believed to be reliable information that Younis was involved in a secret dialogue with Saif al-
Islam Oaddafi, the son of Libyan leader Muammar Oaddafi. These discussions involved planning for Younis and Saif al-
Islam to establish a government of reconciliation, with Muammar Qaddafi living in internal exile, and the INC being
disbanded in favor of officials, and military officers loyal to Saif and Younis. Jalil ordered Younis arrest, and once he was
in TNC custody instructed security officers to shoot the army commander.
According to these knowledgeable individuals, Jaill and his supporters began disseminating the story that Younis was
killed by either pro-Qaddafi forces, or Islamic radicals within the INC military. There is no indication that rebel Prime
Minister Mahmoud Jabril, his senior aid Abdul Hafiz Ghoza, overall military commander General Abdelessalem Jalloud, or
Younis replacement as field commander General Khaliffa Hefter were involved in the decision to execute Younis.
Younis, was a former senior military officer and Minister of Interior in the Qaddafi regime,â€¢who joined the rebels in
February 2011, after serving his friend Muammar Qaddafi for over 40 years. When Younis first joined the rebel forces
TNC security officers placed him under surveillance, believing that he might have been sent by Qaddafi to infiltrate their
ranks. After a variety of loyalty tests he was welcomed into the rebel leadership, however it now appears that the security
officers maintained their coverage of Younis and at some point in early July established his contact with Saif al-Islam
Qaddafi.
(Source Comment: Knowledgeable sources state that Jalil and his security forces felt that Younis' actions posed an
immediate threat to the TNC and the ongoing revolution. Jalil made the decision to order Younis' arrest and execution
rather than submit the matter for debate in the 31 member TNC. To date these sources add that there is no indication
that none of the TNC members have challenged Jalil's decision.)

Jalil remains committed to defeating the Qaddafi regime and is unwilling to negotiate with Saif al-Islam, or another
representative of Muammar Qaddafi. According to these sources, Jail' believes reports that the Saif â€” Younis negotiations
had at least the tacit support of the governments of the United States, Germany, France, and Russia.
(Source comment: A separate sensitive source noted that Jalil remains highly suspicious of the activities of the four
governments, and has privately expressed hostility toward their representatives in INC capital of Benghazi. That said he
is well aware of the fact that he will need the support of the major powers, particularly the United States, to guarantee the
future of the TNC government.)

Dear Mr. Sullivan,
As per your request, here is the transcript from Ambassador Rice's appearance on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" We will
forward the transcripts from the other Sunday morning shows as we receive them. Thank you.
Announcer: From NBC News in Washington, MEET THE PRESS with David Gregory.
GREGORY: And good morning. Relative calm this morning in the Middle East after several days of
intense anti-American protests raged across many parts of the Islamic world. But word this morning
that the Obama administration has ordered the evacuation of all but emergency personnel from
diplomatic missions in Tunisia and Sudan. And defense secretary Leon Panetta saying this morning,
the Pentagon has deployed forces to several areas in an increased effort to protect U.S. personnel
and property from the potential of violent protests, the latest consequences, of course, of this
troubling unrest. Joining me now for the very latest, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations,
Susan Rice. Ambassador Rice, welcome back to MEET THE PRESS.

MS. SUSAN RICE (U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations): Thank you, good to be here.
GREGORY: The images as you well know are jarring to Americans watching all of this play out this
week, and we'll share the map of all of this turmoil with ourviewers to show the scale of it across not
just the Arab world, but the entire Islamic world and flashpoints as well. In Egypt, of course, the
protests outside the U.S. embassy there that Egyptian officials were slow to put down. This weekend
in Pakistan, protests as well there. More anti-American rage. Also protests against the drone
strikes. In Yemen, you also had arrests and some deaths outside of our U.S. embassy there. How
much longer can Americans expect to see these troubling images and these protests go forward?
MS. RICE: Well, David, we can't predict with any certainty. But let's remember what has transpired
over the last several days. This is a response to a hateful and offensive video that was widely
disseminated throughout the Arab and Muslim world. Obviously, our view is that there is absolutely
no excuse for violence and thatâ€” what has happened is condemnable, but this is a-- a spontaneous
reaction to a video, and it's not dissimilar but, perhaps, on a slightly larger scale than what we have
seen in the past with The Satanic Verses with the cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad. Now, the
United States has made very clear and the president has been very plain that our top priority is the
protection of American personnel in our facilities and bringing to justice those who...
GREGORY: All right.
MS. RICE: ...attacked our facility in Benghazi.
GREGORY: Well, let's talk-- talk about-- well, you talked about this as spontaneous. Can you say
definitively that the attacks on-- on our consulate in Libya that killed ambassador Stevens and others
there security personnel, that was spontaneous, was it a planned attack? Was there a terrorist
element to it?
MS. RICE: Well, let us-- let me tell you theâ€” the best information we have at present. First of all,
there's an FBI investigation which is ongoing. And we look to that investigation to give us the
definitive word as to what transpired. But putting together the best information that we have available
to us today our current assessment is that what happened in Benghazi was in fact initially a
spontaneous reaction to what had just transpired hours before in Cairo, almost a copycat of-- of the
demonstrations against our facility in Cairo, which were prompted, of course, by the video. What we
think then transpired in Benghazi is that opportunistic extremist elements came to the consulate as
this was unfolding. They came with heavy weapons which unfortunately are readily available in post
revolutionary Libya. And it escalated into a much more violent episode. Obviously, that's-- that's our
best judgment now. We'll await the results of the investigation. And the president has been very
clear--we'll work with the Libyan authorities to bring those responsible to justice.

GREGORY: Was there a failure here that this administration is responsible for, whether it's an
intelligence failure, a failure to see this coming, or a failure to adequately protect U.S. embassies and
installations from a spontaneous kind of reaction like this?
MS. RICE: David, I don't think so. First of all we had no actionable intelligence to suggest thatâ€” that
any attack on our facility in Benghazi was imminent. In Cairo, we did have indications that there was
the risk that the video might spark some-- some protests and our embassy, in fact, acted accordingly,
and had called upon the Egyptian authorities to-- to reinforce our facility. What we have seen as--
with respect to the security response, obviously we had security personnel in Benghazi, a-- a
significant number, and tragically, among those four that were killed were two of our security
personnel. But what happened, obviously, overwhelmed the security we had in place which is why
the president ordered additional reinforcements to Tripoli and-- and why elsewhere in the world we
have been working with governments to ensure they take up their obligations to protect us and we
reinforce where necessary
GREGORY: The president and the secretary of state have talked about a mob mentality. That's my
words, not their words, but they talked about the-- the tyranny of mobs operating in this part of the
world. Here's the reality, if you look at foreign aid--U.S. direct foreign aid to the two countries
involved here, in Libya and Egypt, this is what you'd see: two hundred million since 2011 to Libya,
over a billion a year to Egypt and yet Americans are seeing these kinds of protests and attacks on our
own diplomats. Would-- what do you say to members of congress who are now weighing whether to
suspend our aid to these countries if this is the response that America gets?
MS. RICE: Well, first of all, David, let's put this in perspective. As I said, this is a response to a-- a
very offensive video. It's not the first time that American facilities have come under attack in the
Middle East, going back to 1982 in-- in Beirut, going back to the Khobar Towers in-- in Saudi Arabia,
or even the attack on our embassy in 2008 in Yemen.
GREGORY: Or Iran in 1979.
MS. RICE: This has-- this has happened in the past, but there-- and so I don't think that-- that we
should misunderstand what this is. The reason we provide aid in Egypt and in Libya is because it
serves American interests because the relationships...
GREGORY: But-- but our Americans are not being served if this is the response.
MS. RICE: It serves our interests to have Egypt willing and able to-- to maintain its peace treaty with
Israel, it servers our interest for Egypt to continue to be a strong partner. Now, let's be clear, the
government, once President Obama called President Morsi, immediately in Egypt the security forces
came out and have provided very significant protection. Same in Tunisia, same in Libya, same in

Yemen. And all of these leaders have very forcefully conveyed their condemnation of what has
transpired.
GREGORY: But there were conflicting messages from the Morsi government. In Arabic they
encourage protests, lii English they said stop the protests. This from an ally that we give over a
billion dollars?
MS. RICE: What has happened in fact is that the Egyptian government has come out and protected
our facilities. Our embassy is open today, things are calm. And Morsi has repeatedly been clear in
his condemnation of-- of what has occurred. We-- we are in these partnerships, David, over the long-
term. We think that-- that-- despite this very bumpy path we're on and the very disturbing images
we've seen, it's in the United States fundamental interest that people have the ability to choose their
own governments, that the governments be democratic and free. That's in our long-term best
interest.
GREGORY: You know that this...
MS. RICE: We need to reinforce that with our assistance.
GREGORY: We are in the middle of a heated presidential campaign, there are different foreign
policy visions. That's why we wanted to dedicate the hour to this today to really understand these
different views. Mitt Romney spoke out this week, he criticized the administration, talked about
whether the United States was apologizing for some of the initial response to this. These were his
comments this week.
(Videotape; Wednesday)
MR. MITT ROMNEY: The administration was wrong to stand by a statement sympathizing with those
who had breached our embassy in Egypt instead of condemning their actions. I think it's a-- a-- a
terrible course to-- for America to-- to stand in apology for our values.
(End videotape)
GREGORY: Our embassies did not stand up for speech-- free speech in this initial response to this
violence. And the Republican charge is that it's weakness on the part of this administration that
invites this kind of chaos, that the administration has not been tough enough on radical extremists
that are beginning to take root in these countries. How do you respond to that?

MS. RICE: First of all, I think the American people and certainly our diplomats and-- and
development experts who are putting their lives on the line around the world every day expect from
our leadership unity in times of challenge and strong, steady, steadfast leadership of the sort that
President Obama has been providing. With respect to this, I think, vacuous charge of weakness,
let's-- lets recall, I think, the American people fully understand that this is an administration led by a
president who said when he ran for office that he would take the fight to at Qaeda. We have
decimated at Qaeda. Osama bin Laden is dead. He said we would end the war responsibly in
Iraq. We've done that. He has restored relationships around the world. I spend every day up at the
United Nations where I have to interact with 192 other countries. I know how well the United States is
viewed. I know that our standing is much improved and it's translated into important support for
strong American positions, for example with sanctions against Iran.
GREGORY: Was it inappropriate for Governor Romney to level the criticism he leveled?
MS. RICE: I'm not going to get into politics, David. That's not my role in this job. But I think the
American people welcome and appreciate strong, steady, unified leadership, bipartisan in times of
challenge. And for those men and women in our diplomatic service, including those we tragically lost,
they look to our leadership to be unified and responsible.
GREGORY: Let's talk about another area where the administration is on the defensive in terms of
leadership in the world, and that is the nuclear threat from Iran. Another area of tension between the
United States and Israel. In just a couple of minutes we will show our interview with the prime
minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu. And our viewers will see that. One aspect is how close Iran
is getting to becoming a nuclear power. I asked him about that. I want to show you a piece of the
interview and get your reaction to it.
(Videotape)
PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU (Prime Minister of Israel): I can tell you, David, that Iran
has been placed with some clear red lines on a few matters, and they have avoided crossing
them. So I think that as they get closer and closer and closer to the achievement of the weapons-
grade material, and they're very close, they're six months away from being about 90 percent of
having the enriched uranium for an atom bomb, I think that you have to place that red line before
them now, before it's-- it's too late.
GREGORY: As the prime minister of Israel, has Iran crossed your red line?

MR. NETANYAHU: Well, the way I would say it, David, is they are in the red zone. You know, they
are in the last 20 yards. And you can't let them cross that goal line. You can't let them score a
touchdown, because that would have unbelievable consequences, grievous consequences, for the
peace and security of us all-- of the world really.
(End videotape)
GREGORY: What is President Obama's line in the sand, the point at which he says to Iran don't
cross this with your nuclear program or there's going to be a military consequence?
MS. RICE: David, the president has been very, very clear. Our bottom line, if you want to call it a red
line, president's bottom line has been that Iran will not acquire a nuclear weapon and we will take no
option off the table to ensure that it does not acquire a nuclear weapon, including the military option.
GREGORY: The prime minister says...
MS. RICE: But...
GREGORY: ...they are acquiring.
MS. RICE: ...he's talking about a-- a red zone which is a new concept...
GREGORY: No, no, but he's talking about how close they are to actually becoming a nuclear power--
having to develop a capacity to become a nuclear power.
MS. RICE: They're not there yet. They are not there yet. And our assessment is, and-- and we
share this regularly with our Israeli counterparts in the intelligence and defense community, that there
is time and space for the pressure we are mounting, which is unprecedented in terms of sanctions, to
still yield results. This is not imminent. The window is not infinite, but let's be clear--the sanctions
that-- that are now in place reached their high point in July. The-- the Iranian economy is
suffering. It's shrinking for the first time. Negative one percent growth. The amount of production of
Iranian oil has dropped 40 percent over the last several months. Their currency has plummeted 40
percent over the last several months. This pressure is even to use the Iranian's own words crippling.
GREGORY: But can you say...
MS. RICE: And we think...
GREGORY: ...that President Obama's strategy to keep Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon almost
at the end of his first term is succeeding or failing?

MS. RICE: David, what is clear is Iran does not have a nuclear weapon. And that Iran is more
isolated than ever internationally. The economic pressure it is facing is much greater than
ever. When President Obama came to office the international community was divided about
Iran. And Iran was internally very united. The exact opposite is the case today. The international
community is united. We just had another strong resolution out of the IAEA Board of Governors. And
the internal dynamics in Iran are-- are fracturing and the leadership is divided. We are committed and
President Obama is committed to preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. It is not a policy
of containment. But, David, the most difficult and profound decision that any president has to make is
the decision to go to war. And this president is committed to exhausting pressure, economic
pressure, and diplomacy while there is-- is still time before making a decision of such consequence.
GREGORY: Ambassador Rice, the debate continues. Thank you very much...
MS. RICE: Thank you.
GREGORY: ...for your views this morning.
Now to this looming nuclear threat from Iran from the Israeli perspective. There were new tensions
between the Obama administration in Israel this week. Earlier, I spoke with the prime minister of
Israel Benjamin Netanyahu about where things stand and whether he is trying to influence the
outcome of our presidential campaign.

It is almost inevitable in an election year that Republicans use every possible opportunity to attack the Obama
Administration. Part of these attacks have been effort to embarrass the President by turning the killing of
Ambassador Stevens into a ""goteha"" contest where the President is somehow blamed for largely local security
decisions and ""intelligence failures."" The Administration, in turn, has fumbled the situation by going into a state
of confused denial -- focusing on the uncertain chronology of events that led to Ambassador Chris Stevens'
death.

The Republicans seem to be ""winning"" in political terms, largely because so few Americans in think tanks and
the media realize that virtually all intelligence and security post-mortems on such events uncover the same
problems. Once the event is over and clear patterns emerge, there are always warning indicators that could have
been heeded in retrospect. If one ignores that vast amount of ""noise"" from other conflicting indicators, and
looks back with 20-20 hindsight, every such event is always an ""intelligence"" failure.
Moreover, competent security officers always are asking for more support and coverage in any area where risks
exist. There is never enough security even in the best funded times, and these are not the best funded times.
Almost every aspect of U.S. diplomacy has been subject to budget cuts at a time of upheaval in the Arab world
and global economic crisis.
A recent article by Dana Milbank in the Washington Post notes that the same Republican dominated House that
now critiques events in Libya cut State Department operations by $300 million in 2009 and eliminated funds for
some 30 more security positions along with it. The House cut security funding by $128 million in FY2011 and
$331 million in FY2012, although the Senate restored $88 million. Under at least one of Congressman Ryan's
proposals to amend the budget, State Department funding would be cut by an additional 20% million in 2014 â€“
which means another $400 million cut in security.
It is no tribute to the Obama Administration that it did far too little to push back against these cuts, and even
less to articulate the need to fund stronger U.S. ""expeditionary diplomacy"" efforts. Indeed, at a time when far
too many countries are in crisis and the U.S. faces increased challenges to its regional goals, more funds,
stronger country teams, increased humanitarian aid, beefed-up military assistance, and on-the-scene diplomacy
is needed to support U.S. interests.
In fairness to Secretary Clinton and the large number of dedicated diplomatic professionals, State has tried to
deal with these challenges by refocusing its diminishing resources, strengthening its ability to provide on-the-
scene aid, and creating civil efforts that can deal with crises like Syria and the need to provide stronger U.S. aid
and advisory teams if dictators like Assad fall.
So far, both the Republican ""gotcha"" efforts and the Administration's failure to make the case for strong
""expeditionary diplomacy"" have totally failed to serve the U.S. national interest, and have been the worst
possible memorial to Ambassador Chris Stevens, a man who clearly knew that America's success required risk
taking and action in the field.
It is time we come to grips with the world we actually live in. We can't deal with the political upheavals in a
single Arab country, the impact of Transition in Afghanistan, the internal struggle for the future of Islam,
energy and trade security, the various national crises in Latin America and Africa, or the competition for the
future of Asia by speeches in the U.S., quick visits by senior U.S. officials, outside radio and TV programs, and
empty rhetoric about taking stronger stands or exporting U.S. values.
We need strong country teams, and teams that are active and take risks. We need men and women on the scene
who accept the realities on the ground in the countries they operate in. We need strong country teams that can
work with the full range of factions, provide help in forming political parties and changing governance, provide
carefully selected aid and advisory efforts to catalyze reform, and provide military and security advisors that
can help countries move towards stability without excessive repression and threatening their neighbors.
We need to protect our embassies, consulates, and military advisory groups, but we cannot afford to turn them
in to fortresses that lock our diplomats, aid teams, and military on the scene away from events and the people
they are trying to influence. If there are any real lessons from Libya â€”or Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Yemen,
Somalia, Kenya, Tanzania, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon and all the other nations on the long list of cases where
American diplomats, advisors and security teams died to serve their country â€”it is that projecting any form of

smart power is done on the ground, is done by moving throughout the country, is done by taking risks, and will
inevitably incur casualties.
Some will be ambassadors, some will be aid team personnel or experts in public diplomacy, and some will be
CIA or men and women in uniform. Every one of them will be a tragedy. But we cannot let either false
economies or extremist and terrorist threats defeat such efforts. The cost of properly funded expeditionary
diplomacy â€”people, military and civil aid funds, and fully funded security efforts â€”is going to be cheaper
even on a global level than losing contact and U.S. influence in a single country like Egypt, or being unprepared
to deal with the flow of events in a nation like Syria or Iraq.
It is also already all too clear that extremist elements throughout the world realize that attacks on U.S. diplomats
and military advisors or partners are one of the cheapest and most effective ways to gain immediate visibility,
strike at the heart of U.S. public opinion, drive the U.S. out of a country, or limit its influence. No one needs to
defeat U.S. military forces â€” which can only be deployed to a handful of countries at most â€”if they can expel
or paralyze American diplomacy, support for U.S. businesses and investment, support for U.S. NG0s, and
effective U.S. military and security advisory efforts.
This threat is already all too real in far too many parts of the world, and it has effectively eliminated one of the
key differences between ""hard"" and ""soft"" power. ""Soft"" power cannot survive where it is not protected by
""hard"" power. Moreover, there are few if any crises cases where advice and aid in politics, governance,
economics and rule of law can be separated from a matching need for advice and aid in addressing military,
security, counterterrorism, and national police concerns.
In short, we do not need ""gotcha"" post-mortems or half-formed defenses. The tribute we really owe
Ambassador Chris Stevens is to undertake the following eight steps:
â€¢ Understand that diplomacy will often be a form of asymmetric warfare in crisis countries, particularly
those with crumbling regimes or new unstable governments. Accept the fact there can be no success
without taking increased risk and suffering casualties.
â€¢ Set realistic and achievable goals country-by-country and give the ambassador and country team as
much discretion as possible. Don't set impossible goals for instant democracy, human rights, rule of law
or stability. Accept the need for evolutionary action and ""doing it their way."" Don't try one size fits all
ideological solutions or efforts from Washington.
â€¢ Stop focusing on narrow budget cuts and examine the costs and benefits of effective, well-funded
country team efforts. If properly funded diplomacy and country team efforts only win support for the
U.S. in one crisis country over the next decade, or avoid even one armed intervention, they will still
more than pay for their costs in terms of the U.S. budget, and the overall effort will be immensely more
valuable in terms of gains (and tax revenues) in U.S. trade and investment.
â€¢ Reexamine how to create all of the elements of ""expeditionary diplomacy"" efforts, including strong
country teams, and the ability to suddenly boost teams in countries in crises, with the full range of tools
an ambassador needs. This includes adequate staff, operating and security funds, and flexible aid funds
that can be applied quickly to deal with changing needs and circumstances.
â€¢ Fully fund security but find the best ways to change existing procedures to emphasize mobility and
move to high-risk areas. Refocus intelligence to help reduce risks, and restructure protection efforts to
provide specially trained and equipped U.S. and foreign national security. Stop doing pointless security
post-mortem blame games and focus on the future.
â€¢ Reward and encourage necessary risk taking. Make it clear that this is a key part of a successful career
path, that it will be fully supported by State and other agencies deploying U.S. personnel, and reorient
security efforts in country to protect such efforts in the best ways possible rather than creating rules that
either make effective action impossible or force diplomats and advisors to violate such rules without
protection. Anyone who works with U.S. diplomats, aid workers, and military advisory teams overseas

knows that we have strong cadres ready and willing to take such risks. The challenge is to properly
support them in country and reward them for their service.
Reexamine the insurance coverage, benefits, and salaries of such risk takers. Don't sustain the present
situation in Afghanistan and earlier in Iraq where contractors get massive wage increases and diplomats
and aid workers lack the full equivalent of combat pay and protection for them and their families if they
are killed or disabled. Ensure adequate lasting medical care for lasting injuries.
Finally, see if there is some way the U.S. Congress can address these issues realistically in a way that actually
focuses on U.S. national interests even in a time of petty partisan feeding frenzies. These efforts not only need
the next Administration to fully fund and support them at a time of growing budget pressures, they need
bipartisan support in both Houses of Congress.
There will be a need for outside review, for new reporting requirement and for hearings. But, they need to look
forward. U.S. efforts must serve national interests rather than personal or partisan advantage, accept the
complexity and time needed to deal with country-by-country efforts, and focus on pragmatic ways of dealing
with the future rather than dissecting the past.

Subject: Jeff update
Contrast between Benghazi and reports from the West: Here in Benghazi since Thursday, I have joined our
representative, Chris Stevens, in meetings with a large number of representatives from the TNC, civil society, UN
organizations and NG0s, and the diplomatic corps. While we had no idea that our trip would correspond with significant
military advances in the east and the start of the coordinated Tripoli uprising dubbed ""Operation Mermaid Dawn,"" the
timing gave us the opportunity to note the contrast between the relative bureaucratic quiet here compared to hyped-up
activity in western Libya. Clearly, some coordination is underway between Benghazi and the west: Ali Tarhouni, recently
promoted to Deputy Prime Minister In a still-to-be-completed cabinet reshufle, previewed the Tripoli uprising with us,
down almost to the minute. Yet one feels that, to a large extent, TNC officials are observers and chroniclers rather than
the authors of the unfolding developments to the west. (In a telling anecdote, just after confiding in us the plans for
Tripoli about to unfold, Tarhouni turned off his ringing cell phone, to concentrate on talking to us in a leisurely
manner.) What TNC officials told us to a large extent was sensible and mostly reassuring in its content -- and the TNC
just issued a directive reiterating its policy to treat combatants according to the Geneva conventions and observe human
rights -- but their comments fell mostly in the category of passive analysis rather than aggressive forward
thinking. Washington has task forces in focused on Tripoli; Benghazi does not
While there's a sense in the air that the final battles have begun, that palpable anticipation does not seem to have
translated into the type of stepped-up bureaucratic activity that one would expect. After meeting with us for nearly two
hours on Thursday, TNC Executive Committee chair (and PM equivalent) Mahmoud Jibril returned to Doha rather than
head any kind of war room here. I was on the ground far longer than Jibril, giving another cameo appearance
here. Tarhouni confided that there is no plan for when or how the TNC would relocate quickly to Tripoli, should Tripoli
fall. TNC Chairman Mustafa Abduljalil (who remains by all accounts a unifying figure here) is a humble, retiring leader,
which after Qadhafi's flamboyance is part of the attraction for Libyans but which does not make him naturally think of
how to project INC authority and symbolism quickly to the newly liberated areas. The question is when Tripoli falls, do
the extensive plans that the TNC has made about the post Qadhafi transitional structures have any relevance for
Tripoli? I do not want to overplay this: the flags being raised in the western towns are the flags used here. Our visit to
the military command center demonstrated that there is active information flow (if not exactly command and control)
passing between east and west. Tarhouni and others who visit western towns, usually from Tunis, describe support
there and from tribal leaders across Libya. No other groups are claiming to have established or planned for an
alternative civilian authority to compete with the TNC. Still, in our engagement with TNC officials, we will need to
remind them continually of the imperative to nurture their legitimacy and authority and to prevent a political vacuum
that others could fill -- especially after Tripoli falls and the INC is here, not there.
We've talked a lot about Tripoli and whether a battle for the capital could be avoided, which we argued would be the
best solution. One of the TNC's assets is the moral distinction between what the Libya that the TNC aspires to promote
and how Qadhafi has treated Libya's citizens. The world's attention will focus on a battle for Tripoli, we cautioned, and
acts of brutality and revenge and potential internal fights among competing militias will blur that moral distinction even
more than the assassination of INC Chief of Staff Abdulfatah Younis already did. The damage to the TNC's credibility
could be irreparable. We also noted that a TNC led negotiation that succeeds in winning Tripoli without a fight would
underscore the TNC leadership far more dramatically than a successful militia assault only vaguely connected to the
Benghazi leadership. The TNC officials heard us out patiently, but they clearly were not in the mood to negotiate. They
feel confident about the current military situation, and they remain convinced that Qadhafi simply will not give up no
matter how high the pressure. If anything, their positions have hardened in recent weeks, with Abduljalil telling us that
the TNC will no longer contemplate Qadhafi staying in Libya once he is out of power. Saif Qadhafi is seen in the same
category as his father. I do not believe that anything short of a significant change -- Qadhafi's departure, a military

setback that punctures the TNC's current confidence, NATO insisting on a pause in operations in favor of negotiations --
will persuade the TNC leadership that it is in their interest right now to offer Qadhafi a peaceful way out. Tarhouni also
acknowledged with his trademark candor that, to the Libyan people right now, negotiations would appear weak and
not a satisfactory climax to the revolution. They do have a point that, despite signs of desperation around Qadhafi (e.g.,
Mohammed Ismail's multiple attempts to contact Gene Cretz and me), there is no indication that Qadhafi himself is
prepared to throw in the towel. There is real fear that, should Qadhafi somehow make it from Tripoli to Sebha, a guerilla
war could persist for years, with supplies and mercernaries smuggled across the Saharan border.
Among other topics, we pushed the INC officials hard on starting a high-profile discussion immediately on the
reconciliation which is part of the TNC's platform. We noted that the many victims of Qadhafi's 42-year rule will be less
likely to pursue individual acts of revenge If they are assured that there will be some form to address grievances through
rule-of-law accountability. The same message should also appeal to average Libyans who for whatever reason remained
as part of Qadhafi's regime to the end but who have no blood on their hands and might otherwise fear retribution. INC
officials refer approvingly to the South African and Moroccan models, and they reiterated their commitment for an
inclusive process for Libya's future that welcomes all but the most notorious individuals around Qadhafi. Yet they still
seem to rely largely on (variously described) luck, tribal discipline, and the ""gentle character"" of the Libyan people as the
best assurances against abuse and revenge killings. We will continue to push on this.
Benghazi remained full of chatter about the Abdulfatah Younis assassination. With tribal visits and investigation
committees and cabinet changes, the INC addressed the immediate crisis sufficiently effectively that the intiial tension
and gunfire quickly dissipated. But the assassination highlighted two realities of Libyan life that TNC officials had
previously tried to downplay: tribes and militias. Rather than denying the tribal affiliations of Libyans, TNC officials are
now looking to the tribes as part of the solution in enforcing discipline and preventing the type of widescale looting and
pillaging that destroyed Benghazi's security infrastructure in March. Tribes, we heard, can also be a corrective balance
to Islamist leanings. On reining in the militias, we heard no good answers. Some people (Tarhouni, INC National
Security Advisor Bazama, some civil society representatives) spoke frankly about the problem, including the Islamist
leanings of the most powerful. The Islamist militias deserve more discussion in other channels, but a couple of people
noted that the Younis assassination had an upside in making scrutiny of this issue imperative. Others seemed to rely,
again, on luck or tried to avert their eyes from the problem that militias could post on the Day After. There was
widespread disdain for Qatar's role in encouraging certain militia elements, and I will be able to cite lots of concern here
when I go to Doha later. Qatar's role, too, is a subject better discussed elsewhere.
We also discussed humanitarian and financial needs. Tarhouni and Jibril noted that the TNC's financial needs increase as
more territory falls under rebel control; they are worried that, if they can't provide electricity to newly liberated towns
or fund other services there, disenchantment with the TNC will grow. Tarhouni agreed to reach out to the Indians to
discuss Libya's outstanding debts, to see if he can help us get India's hold on the frozen asset proposal lifted. Briefed on
South Africa's objections, fibril understood the need for continued outreach to Africa (although part of our South Africa
problem may derive from Jibril's poor relations with Zuma, with Jibril telling us that he recently accused Zuma of making
Nelson Mandela feel ashamed); Abdulrahman Shalgam will go to the August 25-26 AU Summit and Jibril did not rule out
attending himself. I've spoken several times to UAE Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed since arriving here, and the
UAE has finally responded positively to our soft collateral proposal for a loan to the TNC, which may be our fastest way
of getting funds here, assuming we can come up with a letter that meets the UAE's needs and passes the scrutiny of the
U.S. interagency process.
My traveling companions, Bill Roebuck (NEA/MAG director) and Ben Fishman from the NSS, start their return trip today.
I will go on to Cairo, Doha, and Abu Dhabi, where, inter alia, I will have more Libya discussions, including seeing Jibril
again in Doha. With NileSat continuing to broadcast Qadhafi's propaganda, the Libyan anger over Egypt's role
approaches if not exceeds annoyance with Qataar. We are also checking on how to get from Cairo back here, should I
need to join Chris here in the coming days.
Chris and his tiny staff are doing a heroic job in representing our interests here. I am especially appreciative to DS for all
the work done to support my trip. I also want to highlight the work that Pat Kennedy's M family and NEA/EX did in
establiishing living and working quarters for Chris and his team. Thanks to a lot of creativity and hard work, the

It is almost inevitable in an election year that Republicans use every possible opportunity to attack the Obama.
Administration. Part of these attacks have been effort to embarrass the President by turning the killing of
Ambassador Stevens into a ""goteha"" contest where the President is somehow blamed for largely local security
decisions and ""intelligence failures."" The Administration, in turn, has fumbled the situation by going into a state
of confused denial â€“ focusing on the uncertain chronology of events that led to Ambassador Chris Stevens'
death.

The Republicans seem to be ""winning"" in political terms, largely because so few Americans in think tanks and
the media realize that virtually all intelligence and security post-mortems on such events uncover the same
problems. Once the event is over and clear patterns emerge, there are always warning indicators that could have
been heeded in retrospect. If one ignores that vast amount of ""noise"" from other conflicting indicators, and
looks back with 20-20 hindsight, every such event is always an ""intelligence"" failure.
Moreover, competent security officers always are asking for more support and coverage in any area where risks
exist. There is never enough security even in the best funded times, and these are not the best funded times.
Almost every aspect of U.S. diplomacy has been subject to budget cuts at a time of upheaval in the Arab world
and global economic crisis.
A recent article by Dana Milbank in the Washington Post notes that the same Republican dominated House that
now critiques events in Libya cut State Department operations by $300 million in 2009 and eliminated funds for
some 30 more security positions along with it. The House cut security funding by $128 million in FY2011 and
$33! million in FY2012, although the Senate restored $88 million. Under at least one of Congressman Ryan's
proposals to amend the budget, State Department funding would be cut by an additional 20% million in 2014 â€“
which means another $400 million cut in security.
It is no tribute to the Obama Administration that it did far too little to push back against these cuts, and even
less to articulate the need to fund stronger U.S. ""expeditionary diplomacy"" efforts. Indeed, at a time when far
too many countries are in crisis and the U.S. faces increased challenges to its regional goals, more funds,
stronger country teams, increased humanitarian aid, beefed-up military assistance, and on-the-scene diplomacy
is needed to support U.S. interests.
In fairness to Secretary Clinton and the large number of dedicated diplomatic professionals, State has tried to
deal with these challenges by refocusing its diminishing resources, strengthening its ability to provide on-the-
scene aid, and creating civil efforts that can deal with crises like Syria and the need to provide stronger U.S. aid
and advisory teams if dictators like Assad fall.
So far, both the Republican ""gotcha"" efforts and the Administration's failure to make the case for strong
""expeditionary diplomacy"" have totally failed to serve the U.S. national interest, and have been the worst
possible memorial to Ambassador Chris Stevens, a man who clearly knew that America's success required risk
taking and action in the field.
It is time we come to grips with the world we actually live in. We can't deal with the political upheavals in a
single Arab country, the impact of Transition in Afghanistan, the internal struggle for the future of Islam,
energy and trade security, the various national crises in Latin America and Africa, or the competition for the
future of Asia by speeches in the U.S., quick visits by senior U.S. officials, outside radio and TV programs, and
empty rhetoric about taking stronger stands or exporting U.S. values.
We need strong country teams, and teams that are active and take risks. We need men and women on the scene
who accept the realities on the ground in the countries they operate in. We need strong country teams that can
work with the full range of factions, provide help in forming political parties and changing governance, provide
carefully selected aid and advisory efforts to catalyze reform, and provide military and security advisors that
can help countries move towards stability without excessive repression and threatening their neighbors.
We need to protect our embassies, consulates, and military advisory groups, but we cannot afford to turn them
in to fortresses that lock our diplomats, aid teams, and military on the scene away from events and the people
they are trying to influence. If there are any real lessons from Libya â€”or Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Yemen,
Somalia, Kenya, Tanzania, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon and all the other nations on the long list of cases where
American diplomats, advisors and security teams died to serve their country it is that projecting any form of

smart power is done on the ground, is done by moving throughout the country, is done by taking risks, and will
inevitably incur casualties.
Some will be ambassadors, some will be aid team personnel or experts in public diplomacy, and some will be
CIA or men and women in uniform. Every one of them will be a tragedy. But we cannot let either false
economies or extremist and terrorist threats defeat such efforts. The cost of properly funded expeditionary
diplomacy â€”people, military and civil aid funds, and fully funded security efforts â€”is going to be cheaper
even on a global level than losing contact and U.S. influence in a single country like Egypt, or being unprepared
to deal with the flow of events in a nation like Syria or Iraq.
It is also already all too clear that extremist elements throughout the world realize that attacks on U.S. diplomats
and military advisors or partners are one of the cheapest and most effective ways to gain immediate visibility,
strike at the heart of U.S. public opinion, drive the U.S. out of a country, or limit its influence. No one needs to
defeat U.S. military forces â€” which can only be deployed to a handful of countries at most â€”if they can expel
or paralyze American diplomacy, support for U.S. businesses and investment, support for U.S. NG0s, and
effective U.S. military and security advisory efforts.
This threat is already all too real in far too many parts of the world, and it has effectively eliminated one of the
key differences between ""hard"" and ""soft"" power. ""Soft"" power cannot survive where it is not protected by
""hard"" power. Moreover, there are few if any crises cases where advice and aid in politics, governance,
economics and rule of law can be separated from a matching need for advice and aid in addressing military,
security, counterterrorism, and national police concerns.
In short, we do not need ""gotcha"" post-mortems or half-formed defenses. The tribute we really owe
Ambassador Chris Stevens is to undertake the following eight steps:
â€¢ Understand that diplomacy will often be a form of asymmetric warfare in crisis countries, particularly
those with crumbling regimes or new unstable governments. Accept the fact there can be no success
without taking increased risk and suffering casualties.
â€¢ Set realistic and achievable goals country-by-country and give the ambassador and country team as
much discretion as possible. Don't set impossible goals for instant democracy, human rights, rule of law
or stability. Accept the need for evolutionary action and ""doing it their way."" Don't try one size fits all
ideological solutions or efforts from Washington.
â€¢ Stop focusing on narrow budget cuts and examine the costs and benefits of effective, well-funded
country team efforts. If properly funded diplomacy and country team efforts only win support for the
U.S. in one crisis country over the next decade, or avoid even one armed intervention, they will still
more than pay for their costs in terms of the U.S. budget, and the overall effort will be immensely more
valuable in terms of gains (and tax revenues) in U.S. trade and investment.
â€¢ Reexamine how to create all of the elements of ""expeditionary diplomacy"" efforts, including strong
country teams, and the ability to suddenly boost teams in countries in crises, with the full range of tools
an ambassador needs. This includes adequate staff, operating and security funds, and flexible aid funds
that can be applied quickly to deal with changing needs and circumstances.
Fully fund security but find the best ways to change existing procedures to emphasize mobility and
move to high-risk areas. Refocus intelligence to help reduce risks, and restructure protection efforts to
provide specially trained and equipped U.S. and foreign national security. Stop doing pointless security
post-mortem blame games and focus on the future.
â€¢ Reward and encourage necessary risk taking. Make it clear that this is a key part of a successful career
path, that it will be fully supported by State and other agencies deploying U.S. personnel, and reorient
security efforts in country to protect such efforts in the best ways possible rather than creating rules that
either make effective action impossible or force diplomats and advisors to violate such rules without
protection. Anyone who works with U.S. diplomats, aid workers, and military advisory teams overseas

knows that we have strong cadres ready and willing to take such risks. The challenge is to properly
support them in country and reward them for their service.
Reexamine the insurance coverage, benefits, and salaries of such risk takers. Don't sustain the present
situation in Afghanistan and earlier in Iraq where contractors get massive wage increases and diplomats
and aid workers lack the full equivalent of combat pay and protection for them and their families if they
are killed or disabled. Ensure adequate lasting medical care for lasting injuries.
Finally, see if there is some way the U.S. Congress can address these issues realistically in a way that actually
focuses on U.S. national interests even in a time of petty partisan feeding frenzies. These efforts not only need
the next Administration to fully fund and support them at a time of growing budget pressures, they need
bipartisan support in both Houses of Congress.
There will be a need for outside review, for new reporting requirement and for hearings. But, they need to look
forward. U.S. efforts must serve national interests rather than personal or partisan advantage, accept the
complexity and time needed to deal with country-by-country efforts, and focus on pragmatic ways of dealing
with the future rather than dissecting the past.

Re: Plans of new Libyan PM
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the
highest levels of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1.On October 15, 2012, new Lib3.7a Prime Minister Ah Zidan discussed the future structure of
his cabinet and administration with senior advisors to interim President Yussef el Magariaf
According to a sensitive source, Zidan stated that he intends to draw on all sectors of the Libyan
political world to form his cabinet He also advised that while he must proceed with caution he will
have at least one and possibly as many as three members of the Muslim Brotherhood (MB) and its
Justice and Construction Party (JCP) included in the cabinet. Zidan believes that he can find
members of the JCP and other Islamist groups who support his plan for establishing a moderate
Islamic state, while maintaining good working relations with the United States and Western Europe.
Zidan also plans to reach out to the supporters of Islamist General Abolel Hakim Alarnin Belhaj, who
he believes can be used as a balance against al Qai'cla in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and Ansar al
Sharia as they attempt to undermine the new administration.
2. In the opinion of this individual Zidan is committed to Magariafs policy of seeking
constructive relationships with international oil companies. In this regard, Zidan is looking for an
individual to serve as Minister of Oil who has the appropriate experience and reputation in the
International Oil industry, while maintaining Islamic credentials that will allow the Minister to work
with the ,JCP and conservative independent members of the General National Congress (GNC). Zidan
believes this will be among his greatest challenges. At the same time, this individual notes that Zidan
has complained that he and Magarial are under pressure from the Mohammed Morsi and the Muslim
Brotherhood Government of Egypt to use Egyptian oil service firms to replace Western firms in
supporting the Libyan oil industry. Zidan is skeptical about this idea, fearing that Libya could become
too dependent on Egypt for technical expertise. He believes that Western firms provide the
opportunity to maintain independence and balance in the oil sector,

3.(Source Comment: In the opinion of this source. Zidan, who served at the Libyan Mission to
India for two years before defecting to the West in 1980, joining Magariaf and his anti- Qaddafl,
National Front for the Salvation of Libya (NFSL), plans to work with all of the parties and groups in
the GNC. At the same time his history gives the Prime Minister a relationship with the President and
a degree of credibility that will be helpful as he forms his cabinet. According to this source, Zidan
wants to move quickly to name a cabinet. His position is also strengthened by the fact that he worked
on behalf of the National Transitional Council (NTC) during the 2011 Civil War, organizing
international support for the rebels. According to this sensitive source, Zidan's immediate concerns
include organizing the investigation of the September 11 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi,
and the resulting assassination of Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. Zidan
is already under pressure from the U.S. Government to move the investigation along as quickly as
possible.)
4. In the opinion of this individual Zidan realizes that the attack on the U.S. consulate is now
an international symbol of the security issues at play in Libya, and that the use of pro-government
militias to provide security is not a long term solution to the problem. Zidan believes that the idea
that the government must ask for support from the powerful militias from Misrata and Zintan
undermines his efforts to bring order and centralized authority to the country. Zidan believes that he
can address this problem in part by developing a working majority in the GNC drawing on moderates
and independents, who will support his efforts to establish a modern Islamic regime that can work
with the West, particularly International Oil Companies. That said, he cautions his advisors that he
does not anticipate real success in this regard until the latter part of 2013.

Subject: Video shows Libyans helping rescue US ambassador after attack (Reuters)
BENGHAZI (Reuters) - An amateur video appears to show Libyans trying to rescue U.S. ambassador
Christopher Stevens from a room filled with smoke at the U.S. mission where he was found unconscious after
last week's attack by a mob protesting against a film that denigrates the Prophet Mohammad.
The video,, which appeared on the interne and a copy of which was obtained by Reuters in Benghazi,
confirms reports that suggested the U.S. envoy died of asphyxiation after the building caught fire.
The footage also sheds new light on the circumstances of the ambassador's death, apparently showing for the
first time that some of the people who forced their way into the U.S. compound later tried to rescue Stevens
after they found him lying alone, with no security detail, in one of the rooms in the building.
The video shows a group of young men who had earlier stormed the compound telling other protesters by the
light of torches and mobile phones that they had found someone who appeared to be a foreigner lying on the
floor.
""There is someone inside He is a foreigner, he is a foreigner. Take him out,"" said one man, shouting for
help.
""Bring him out, man! Bring him out,"" another said.
""The man is alive. Bring him out, man. Bring him out,"" said a third.
""Alive, Alive! God is Greatest,"" the crowd cried. Someone called for a car.
""Make space, is there someone who is a medic around? Anyone who can get a car quickly?"" another man can
be heard saying.
Stevens and three other embassy staff died when gunmen attacked the U.S. consulate and a safe house in the
eastern Libyan city on Tuesday night. The attackers were part of a crowd blaming America for a film they said
insulted the Prophet Mohammad.
Security personnel were separated from Stevens during the attack, U.S. officials said, in the chaos of smoke
and gunfire that ensued.
The identity and motive of the attackers remain unclear. Activists who took part in the protest said the
motive was rage at the video produced in California and which describes the Prophet as a homosexual and

Some Libyan officials blamed the attack on radical Islamist groups linked to al Qaeda, such as regional
affiliate Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, and Ansar al-Sharia. Both groups back the introduction of Islamic
Sharia law rather than democracy.
The footage shows Stevens lying on the floor in a smoke-filled room after protesters had stormed the
compound and set fire to its buildings.
Minutes later he was pulled out of the room through a window, and then placed on the courtyard's stone tile
floor. A young man is seen putting his hand on his neck to check if he was breathing.
A protester wearing a white T-shirt who had carried Stevens out of the room was hugged by a fellow
protestor in a traditional expression of gratitude.
Seconds after the protesters found Stevens was alive, a young man in the background can be heard shouting:
""Take him to my car, bring him to my car.""
A doctor on duty in the emergency room at the Benghazi Medical Centre that night has said local civilians
brought in the ambassador at around 1 a.m. While the doctor performed CPR for 45 minutes, Stevens died of
asphyxiation due to smoke inhalation. His body was later returned to U.S. custody.

BENGHAZI, lli3YA â€” Hundreds of protesters angry over last week's killing of the U.S. ambassador to Libya stormed the
compound of the Islamic extremist militia suspected in the attack, evicting militiamen and setting fire to their building
Friday.
In an unprecedented show of public anger at Libya's rampant militias, the crowd overwhelmed the compound of the
Ansar Al-Sharlah Brigade in the center of the eastern city of Benghazi.
Ansar Al-Shariah fighters initially fired in the air to disperse the crowd, but eventually abandoned the site with their
weapons and vehicles after it was overrun by waves of protesters shouting ""No to militias.""
""I don't want to see armed men wearing Afghani-style clothes stopping me in the street to give me orders, I only want to
see people in uniform,"" said Omar Mohammed, a university student who took part in the takeover of the site, which
protesters said was done in support of the army and police.
No deaths were reported in the incident, which came after tens of thousands marched in Benghazi against armed
militias. One vehicle was also burned at the compound.
For many Libyans, the Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi was the last straw in one of the biggest
problems Libya has faced since the ouster and death of longtime dictator Moamrnar Qaddafi around a year ago -- the
multiple mini-armies that with their arsenals of machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades are stronger than the
regular armed forces and police.
The militias, a legacy of the rag-tag popular forces that fought Qaddafi's regime, tout themselves as protectors of Libya's
revolution, providing security where police cannot. But many say they act like gangs, detaining and intimidating rivals
and carrying out killings.
Militias made up of Islamic radicals like Ansar Al-Shariah are notorious for attacks on Muslims who don't abide by their
hardline ideology. Officials and witnesses say fighters from Ansar Al-Shariati led the attack on the U.S. consulate, which
killed Amb. Chris Stevens and three other Americans.
After taking over the Ansar compound, protesters then drove to attack the Benghazi headquarters of another Islamist
militia, Rafallah Sahati. The militiamen opened fire on the protesters, who were largely unarmed. At least 20 were
wounded, and there were unconfirmed witness reports of three protesters killed.
Earlier in the day, some 30,000 people filled a broad boulevard as they marched along a lake in central Benghazi on
Friday to the gates of the headquarters of Ansar Al-Shariah.
""No, no, to militias,"" the crowd chanted, filling a broad boulevard. They carried banners and signs demanding that
militias disband and that the government build up police to take their place in keeping security. ""Benghazi is in a trap,""
signs read. ""Where is the army, where is the police?""

Other signs mourned the killing of Stevens, reading, ""The ambassador was Libya's friend"" and ""Libya lost a friend.""
Military helicopters and fighter jets flew overhead, and police mingled in the crowd, buoyed by the support of the
protesters.
The march was the biggest seen in Benghazi, Libya's second largest city and home to 1 million people, since the fall of
Qaddafi in August 2011. The public backlash comes in part in frustration with the interim government, which has been
unable to rein in the armed factions. Many say that officials' attempts to co-opt fighters by paying them have only fueled
the growth of militias without bringing them under state control or integrating them into the regular forces.
Residents of another main eastern city, Darna, have also begun to stand up against Ansar Al-Shariah and other militias.
The anti-militia fervor in Darna is notable because the city, in the mountains along the Mediterranean coast north of
Benghazi, has long had a reputation as a stronghold for Islamic extremists. During the Qaddafi era, it was the hotbed of a
deadly Islamist insurgency against his regime.
A significant number of the Libyan jihadists who travelled to Afghanistan and Iraq during recent wars came from Darna.
During the revolt against him last year, Qaddafi's regime warned that Darna would declare itself an Islamic Emirate and
ally itself with Al Qaeda.
But now, the residents are lashing out against Ansar Al-Shariah, the main Islamic extremist group in the city.
""The killing of the ambassador blew up the situation. It was disastrous,"" said Ayoub al-Shedwi, a young bearded Muslim
preacher in Darna who says he has received multiple death threats because has spoken out against militias on a radio
show he hosts. ""We felt that the revolution is going in vain.""
Leaders of tribes, which are the strongest social force in eastern Libya, have come forward to demand that the militias
disband.
Tribal leaders in Benghazi and Darna announced this week that members of their tribes who are militiamen will no
longer have their protection in the face of anti-militia protests. That means the tribe will not avenge them if they are
killed.
Activists and residents have held a sit-in for the past eight days outside Darna's Sahaba Mosque, calling on tribes to put
an end to the ""state of terrorism"" created by the militias.
Militiamen have been blamed for a range of violence in Darna. On the same day Stevens killed in Benghazi, a number of
elderly Catholic nuns and a priest who have lived in Darna for decades providing free medical services, were attacked,
reportedly beaten or stabbed. There have been 32 killings over the past few months, including the city security chief and
assassinations of former officers from Qaddafi's military.
Darna's residents are conservative, but they largely don't fit the city's reputation as extremists.
Women wear headscarves, but not the more conservative black garb and veil that covers the entire body and face. In
the ancient city's narrow alleys, shops display sleeveless women dresses and the young men racing by in cars blare
Western songs.
And many are impatient with Ansar Al-Sharjah's talk of imposing its strict version of Islamic law. The group's name
means ""Supporters of Shariah Law.""
""We are not infidels for God sake, We have no bars, no discos, we are not practicing vice in the street,"" said Wassam ben
Madin, a leading activist in the city who lost his right eye in clashes with security forces on the first day of the uprising
against Qaddafi. ""This is not the time for talk about Sharjah. Have a state first then talk to me about Sharjah.""

""If they are the 'supporters of Sharjah' then who are we?"" he said. ""We don't want the flag of Al Qaeda raised over
heads,"" he added, referring to Ansar Al-Shariah's black banner.
One elder resident at the Sahaba Mosque sit-in, Ramadan Yousset said, ""We will talk to them peacefully. We will tell
them you are from us and you fought for us"" during the civil war against Qaddafi. But 'if you say no (to integrating into
the) police and army, we will storm your place. It's over.""
Officials in the interim government and security forces say they are not strong enough to crack down on the militias. The
armed factions have refused government calls for them to join the regular army and police.
So the government has created a ""High Security Committee"" aimed at grouping the armed factions as a first step to
integration, Authorities pay fighters a salary of as much as 1,000 dinars, around $900, to join -- compared to the average
police monthly salary of around $200.
However, the militias that join still do not abide by government authority, and critics say the lure of salaries has only
prompted more militias to form.
Officials and former rebel commanders estimate the number of rebels that actually fought in the 8-month civil war
against Gadhafi at around 30,000. But those now listed on the High Security Committee payroll have reached several
hundred thousand.
""All these militia and entities are fake ones but it is mushrooming,"" said Khaled Hadar, a Benghazi-based lawyer. 'The
government is only making temporarily solutions, but you are creating a disaster.""

Subject: FW: Benghazi update (1200 local)
Update from Rep. Stevens in Benghazi, based on largely on info from acting PM Afi Tarhouni and acting FM
Salah Bishari:
â€¢ TNC caretaker cabinet/members were up until 4am following events in Tripoli and discussing plans for
the coming days. Tarhouni said the TNC has been in constant communication with its people in Tripoli,
including both fighters and those entrusted with implementing the stabilization plans. Rebels in Tripoli,
in coordination with the TNC, have begun to set up checkpoints inside the city and guard public
buildings
â€¢ TNC chairman Abd al Jalil and PM Jibril made statements to the media last night, urging people to
refrain from revenge attacks and destruction of public buildings.
â€¢ There has so far been ""no bloodbath"" or serious looting.
â€¢ The capture of Saif al-Islam al-Qadhafi and Mohamed al-Qadhafi is significant. The TNC, including
Abd al-Jalil himself, intervened with rebels surrounding Mohamed's house to ensure that they did not
harm him. They understood that it would be harmful to the revolution and the TNC if he were
killed. These events were captured live by Al Jazeera in interviews with Mohamed. Both brothers are
in rebel custody (at this time, it is unclear to us exactly who is holding them, however).
â€¢ Per Tarhouni, the next steps are: 1) find Muammar Qadhafi; 2) issue a statement announcing the end of
the Qadhaii regime and the start of the interim period under the TNC (TNC staff have begun drafting
this statement already); 3) insure the delivery of essential services and commodities (esp. addressing the
acute shortages of fuel, children's milk, and medication for blood pressure and diabetes); and 4) move
the TNC to Tripoli.
â€¢ Regarding the move to Tripoli, Tarhouni said security arrangements would need to be made before they
could send the TNC leadership to the capital. We have heard from another contact that some TNC
members are already making plans to fly to Misurata and the Western Mountains, possibly as early as
today, and from there drive to Tripoli.
â€¢ Request for assistance: Tarhouni, who also holds US citizenship, said the items listed above (gas, diesel,
baby milk, and medicine) are urgently needed in Tripoli and recommended that the USG ship those
items directly to Zawiya's Port and publicize such assistance as soon as feasible (in coordination with
the TNC). Ile said this would bring the US even more goodwill than it has already earned here.

Subject: Les Gelb on the Obama response
The whole thing is worth a read, but a very tough judge gives you and the President credit:
By any standard of reason, President Obama and Secretary of State Canton conducted themselves very well amid the
confusion and crises Of course they didn't do everything perfectly; for example, some unidentified administration official
disowned the embassy statement condemning the video. Such creepiness served only to make it look like Obama was
running for cover at the expense of our embattled diplomats. But minor miscues aside, Obama and Clinton nailed the
main points, especially Clinton. In her first statement soon after the riots, here s what she said The United States
deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of others. Our commitment to religious tolerance goes back
to the very beginning of our nation. But let me be clear There is never any justification for violent acts of this kind.""

approved at the Chicago summit â€” gave her inaugural address, and my DOD colleague and I discussed the US efforts
both generally and in Afghanistan. We were followed by extensive remarks from the NATO ambassadors, all of whom
touched on the importance of women's role in security and NATO's mission, as well as applauded US leadership. Many
mentioned you in their interventions! The ambs from Serbia, Azerbaijan and Georgia pointed to their own national
action plans (their existence was a surprise to us), as well as the new structures they have put in place to implement
them. The ambassador from Azerbaijan even said that he is hopeful women will contribute to ending their regional
conflict (I will tell Morningstar). The new special rep - a seasoned diplomat who knows her way around NATO --- wanted
me to ten you how much you have inspired her -- something I hear everywhere!
I'm confident our NATO visit also served to reinforce the importance of the NAP and the US role with our own people
both at NATO and DOD.
I was sorry to miss the discussion with ASSK but there are more events with her tomw. We are working hard on getting
the engagement of Burmese women into the formal peace structures being put in place to end the ethnic conflicts.
I also met with Vivian Redding at the EU who, despite her efforts, is unlikely to get a quota for women on public boards
of directors adopted. She too expressed her admiration of you and your leadership.
In addition to everything that's been said about Chris Stevens, he really understood the important role the women in
Libya were playing in peace and security. Whenever I met with Libyan women at meetings in the region, they went out
of their way to tell me how much he supported them and how much affection they had for him. Such an awful loss.
You've been magnificent throughout all this, despite how wrenching it's been.

Update from Rep. Stevens in Benghazi, based on largely on info from acting PM Ali Tarhouni and acting FM
Salah Bishari:
â€¢ TNC caretaker cabinet/members were up until 4am following events in Tripoli and discussing plans for
the coming days. Tarhouni said the TNC has been in constant communication with its people in Tripoli,
including both fighters and those entrusted with implementing the stabilization plans. Rebels in Tripoli,
in coordination with the TNC, have begun to set up checkpoints inside the city and guard public
buildings.
â€¢ TNC chairman Abd al Jalil and PM Jibril made statements to the media last night, urging people to
refrain from revenge attacks and destruction of public buildings.
â€¢ There has so far been ""no bloodbath"" or serious looting.
â€¢ The capture of Sail al-Islam al-Qadhafi and Mohamed al-Qadhafi is significant The TNC, including
Abd al-Jalil himself, intervened with rebels surrounding Mohamed's house to ensure that they did not
harm him. They understood that it would be harmful to the revolution and the TNC if he were
killed. These events were captured live by Al Jazeera in interviews with Mohamed. Both brothers are
in rebel custody (at this time, it is unclear to us exactly who is holding them, however).
â€¢ Per Tarhouni, the next steps are: 1) find Muammar Qadhafi; 2) issue a statement announcing the end of
the Qadhafi regime and the start of the interim period under the INC (TNC staff have begun drafting
this statement already); 3) insure the delivery of essential services and commodities (esp addressing the
acute shortages of fuel, children's milk, and medication for blood pressure and diabetes); and 4) move
the TNC to Tripoli.
â€¢ Regarding the move to Tripoli, Tarhouni said security arrangements would need to be made before they
could send the TNC.' leadership to the capital. We have heard from another contact that some TNC
members are already making plans to fly to Misurata and the Western Mountains, possibly as early as
today, and from there drive to Tripoli.
â€¢ Request for assistance: Tarhouni, who also holds US citizenship, said the items listed above (gas, diesel,
baby milk, and medicine) are urgently needed in Tripoli and recommended that the USG ship those
items directly to Zawiya's Port and publicize such assistance as soon as feasible (in coordination with
the INC). He said this would bring tlie US even more goodwill than it has already earned bore

Re: Plans of new Libyan PM
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the
highest levels of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1.On October 15, 2012, new Libya Prime Minister All Zidan discussed the future structure of
his cabinet and administration with senior advisors to interim President Yussef el Magariaf.
According to a sensitive source, Zidan stated that he intends to draw on all sectors of the Libyan
political world to form his cabinet. He also advised that while be must proceed with caution he will
have at least one and possibly as many as three members of the Muslim Brotherhood (MB) and its
Justice and Construction Party (JCP) included M the cabinet. Zidari believes that he can find
members of the JCP and other Islamist groups who support his plan for establishing a moderate
Islamic state, while maintaining good working relations with the United States and Western Europe.
Zidan also plans to reach out to the supporters of Islamist General Abdel Hakim Alamin Belhaj, who
he believes can be used as a balance against al Qafda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and Ansar al
Sharia as they attempt to undermine the new administration,
2. In the opinion of this individual Zidan is committed to Magariafs policy of seeking
constructive relationships with international oil companies. In this regard, Zidan is looking for an
individual to serve as Minister of Oil who has the appropriate experience and reputation in the
International Oil industry, while maintaining Islamic credentials that will allow the Minister to work
with the JCP and conservative independent members of the General National Congress (GNC). Zidan
believes this will be among his greatest challenges. At the same time, this individual notes that Zidan
has complained that he and Magariaf are under pressure from the Mohammed Morsi and the Muslim

Brotherhood Government of Egypt to use Egyptian oil service firms to replace Western firms in
supporting the Libyan oil industry. Zidan is skeptical about this idea, fearing that Libya could become
too dependent on Egypt for technical expertise. He believes that Western firms provide the
opportunity to maintain independence and balance in the oil sector.
3.(Source Comment: In the opinion of this source, Zidan, who served at the Libyan Mission to
India for two years before defecting to the West in 1980, joining Magariaf and his anti- Qadd.afi
National Front for the Salvation of Libya (NFSL), plans to work with all of the parties and groups in
the GNC. At the same time his history gives the Prime Minister a relationship with the President and
a degree of credibility that will be helpful as he forms his cabinet. According to this source, Zidan
wants to move quickly to name a cabinet. His position is also strengthened by the fact that he worked
on behalf of the National Transitional Council (NTC) during the 2011Civil War, organizing
international support for the rebels. According to this sensitive source, Ziclan's immediate concerns
include organizing the investigation of the September ii attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi,
and the resulting assassination of Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. Zidan
is already under pressure from the U.S. Government to move the investigation along as quickly as
possible.)
4. In the opinion of this individual Zidan realizes that the attack on the U.S. consulate is now
an international symbol of the security issues at play in Libya, and that the use of pro-government
militias to provide security is not a long term solution to the problem. Zidan believes that the idea
that the government must ask for support from the powerful militias from Misrata and Zintan
undermines his efforts to bring order and centralized authority to the country. Zidan believes that he
can address this problem in part by developing a working majority in the GNC drawing on moderates
and independents, who will support his efforts to establish a modern Islamic regime that can work
with the West, particularly International Oil Companies. That said, he cautions his advisors that he
does not anticipate real success in this regard until the latter part of 2013.

At Andrews Air Force Base on Friday, a military band played ""Nearer, My God, to Thee."" Marines in dress uniforms
carried to four black hearses the flag-draped caskets of the Americans, including Winchester native Glen Doherty, killed
at our consulate in Libya. President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton led the solemn ceremony, Clinton
speaking before him.
""If the last few days teach us anything, let it be this: that this work and the men and women who risk their lives to do it
are at the heart of what makes America great and good,"" said Clinton, her voice at times uneven with emotion for the
dead men she had employed.
Then she said: ""So we will wipe away our tears, stiffen our spines, and face the future undaunted.""
It was a perfect line for America and for Americans who try to keep peace in a smoldering Middle East. It was a line, too,
that captured â€” unwittingly or not â€” how Clinton has lived her life. How many times since this woman took center
stage in this country nearly 20 years ago has she, privately and publicly, wiped away her tears, stiffened her spine, and
faced the future undaunted.
Clinton appeared to be crying again as she listened to Obama, seeming stricken himself. And when Obama finished and
walked back behind the podium, Clinton reached for his hand like an older sister or even a mother, and held it for a
second or two. It was a moment the history books will remember.
There was the first black president on the verge of re-election, or not. There was the woman expected to be the first
female president, until he showed up out of nowhere. There was the rivalry and tortured history, Bill Clinton ever the
third actor in the shadows. But all of it was put aside for something bigger than politics or egos: their country. We don't
see enough of that anymore.
When her husband was president, I made a career out of trashing Hillary Clinton's hairdos, pantsuits, her attempted
health care coup, her right-wing conspiracy theories, her staying with that slippery serial philanderer. Four years ago in
the presidential primary I rooted for Obama over her.
Yet when she finally conceded a totally unexpected defeat, a different Hillary Clinton began to emerge. She surprised us
by accepting a consolation prize, secretary of state. She then went on to perform it so ably that nearly two-thirds of
Americans, an almost unprecedented percentage, approve of her and her rehabilitated â€” or so we hope â€” spouse.
More than once since 2008 I've wondered: Would she have done a better job than Obama? I don't know. But I do know I
sold this woman short.
In awful moments in history, some leaders rise to the occasion, and some don't. Think Ronald Reagan's reassurance
after the Challenger disaster. Or George Bush on the rubble of Ground Zero after 9/11, telling the world we'd never
forget. Friday, by comparison, was a tiny moment. Still, Hillary Clinton rose to meet it.

Update from Rep. Stevens in Benghazi, based on largely on info from acting PM Ali Tarhouni and acting FM
Salah Bishari:
â€¢ TNC caretaker cabinet/members were up until 4am following events in Tripoli and discussing plans for
the coming days. Tarhouni said the TNC has been in constant communication with its people in Tripoli,
including both fighters and those entrusted with implementing the stabilization plans. Rebels in Tripoli,
in coordination with the TNC, have begun to set up checkpoints inside the city and guard public
buildings.
â€¢ INC chairman Abd al Jalil and PM Jibril made statements to the media last night, urging people to
refrain from revenge attacks and destruction of public buildings.
â€¢ There has so far been ""no bloodbath"" or serious looting.
â€¢ The capture of Saif al-Islam al-Qadhafi and Mohamed al-Qadhafi is significant. The TNC, including
Abd al-Jalil himself, intervened with rebels surrounding Mohamed's house to ensure that they did not
harm him. They understood that it would be harmful to the revolution and the TNC if he were
killed. These events were captured live by Al Jazeera in interviews with Mohamed. Both brothers are
in rebel custody (at this time, it is unclear to us exactly who is holding Clem, however).
â€¢ Per Tarhouni, the next steps are: 1) find Muammar Qadhafi; 2) issue a statement announcing the end of
the Qadhafi regime and the start of the interim period under the TNC (TNC staff have begun drafting

this statement already); 3) insure the delivery of essential services and commodities (esp. addressing the
acute shortages of fuel, children's milk, and medication for blood pressure and diabetes); and 4) move
the INC to Tripoli.
â€¢ Regarding the move to Tripoli, Tarhouni said security arrangements would need to be made before they
could send the INC leadership to the capital. We have heard from another contact that some TNC
members are already making plans to fly to Misurata and the Western Mountains, possibly as early as
today, and from there drive to Tripoli.
â€¢ Request for assistance: Tarhouni, who also holds US citizenship, said the items listed above (gas, diesel,
baby milk, and medicine) are urgently needed in Tripoli and recommended that the IJSG ship those
items directly to Zawiya's Port and publicize such assistance as soon as feasible (in coordination with
the TNC). He said this would bring the US even more goodwill than it has already earned here.

It is almost inevitable in an election year that Republicans use every possible opportunity to attack the Obama
Administration. Part of these attacks have been effort to embarrass the President by turning the killing of
Ambassador Stevens into a ""gotcha"" contest where. the President is somehow blamed for largely local security
decisions and ""intelligence failures,"" The Administration, in turn, has fumbled the situation by going into a state
of confused denial -- focusing on the uncertain chronology of events that led to Ambassador Chris Stevens'
death.

The Republicans seem to be ""winning"" in political terms, largely because so few Americans in think tanks and
the media realize that virtually all intelligence and security post-mortems on such events uncover the same
problems. Once the event is over and clear patterns emerge, there are always warning indicators that could have
been heeded in retrospect. If one ignores that vast amount of ""noise"" from other conflicting indicators, and
looks back with 20-20 hindsight, every such event is always an ""intelligence"" failure.
Moreover, competent security officers always are asking for more support and coverage in any area where risks
exist. There is never enough security even in the best funded times, and these are not the best funded times.
Almost every aspect of U.S. diplomacy has been subject to budget cuts at a time of upheaval in the Arab world
and global economic crisis.
A recent article by Dana Milbank in the Washington Post notes that the same Republican dominated House that
now critiques events in Libya cut State Department operations by $300 million in 2009 and eliminated funds for
some 30 more security positions along with it. The House cut security funding by $128 million in FY2011 and
$331 million in FY2012, although the Senate restored $88 million. Under at least one of Congressman Ryan's
proposals to amend the budget, State Department funding would be cut by an additional 20% million in 2014 â€“
which means another $400 million cut in security.
It is no tribute to the Obama Administration that it did far too little to push back against these cuts, and even
less to articulate the need to fund stronger U.S. ""expeditionary diplomacy"" efforts. Indeed, at a time when far
too many countries are in crisis and the U.S. faces increased challenges to its regional goals, more funds,
stronger country teams, increased humanitarian aid, beefed-up military assistance, and on-the-scene diplomacy
is needed to support U.S. interests.
In fairness to Secretary Clinton and the large number of dedicated diplomatic professionals, State has tried to
deal with these challenges by refocusing its diminishing resources, strengthening its ability to provide on-the-
scene aid, and creating civil efforts that can deal with crises like Syria and the need to provide stronger U.S. aid
and advisory teams if dictators like Assad fall.
So far, both the Republican ""gotcha"" efforts and the Administration's failure to make the case for strong
""expeditionary diplomacy"" have totally failed to serve the U.S. national interest, and have been the worst
possible memorial to Ambassador Chris Stevens, a man who clearly knew that America's success required risk
taking and action in the field.
It is time we come to grips with the world we actually live in. We can't deal with the political upheavals in a
single Arab country, the impact of Transition in Afghanistan, the internal struggle for the future of Islam,
energy and trade security, the various national crises in Latin America and Africa, or the competition for the
future of Asia by speeches in the U.S., quick visits by senior U.S. officials, outside radio and TV programs, and
empty rhetoric about taking stronger stands or exporting U.S. values.
We need strong country teams, and teams that are active and take risks. We need men and women on the scene
who accept the realities on the ground in the countries they operate in. We need strong country teams that can
work with the full range of factions, provide help in forming political parties and changing governance, provide
carefully selected aid and advisory efforts to catalyze reform, and provide military and security advisors that
can help countries move towards stability without excessive repression and threatening their neighbors.
We need to protect our embassies, consulates, and military advisory groups, but we cannot afford to turn them
in to fortresses that lock our diplomats, aid teams, and military on the scene away from events and the people
they are trying to influence. If there are any real lessons from Libya â€”or Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Yemen,
Somalia, Kenya, Tanzania, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon and all the other nations on the long list of cases where
American diplomats, advisors and security teams died to serve their country â€”it is that projecting any form of

smart power is done on the ground, is done by moving throughout the country, is done by taking risks, and will
inevitably incur casualties.
Some will be ambassadors, some will be aid team personnel or experts in public diplomacy, and some will be
CIA or men and women in uniform. Every one of them will be a tragedy. But we cannot let either false
economies or extremist and terrorist threats defeat such efforts. The cost of properly funded expeditionary
diplomacy â€”people, military and civil aid funds, and fully funded security efforts â€”is going to be cheaper
even on a global level than losing contact and U.S. influence in a single country like Egypt, or being unprepared
to deal with the flow of events in a nation like Syria or Iraq.
It is also already all too clear that extremist elements throughout the world realize that attacks on U.S. diplomats
and military advisors or partners are one of the cheapest and most effective ways to gain immediate visibility,
strike at the heart of U.S. public opinion, drive the U.S. out of a country, or limit its influence. No one needs to
defeat U.S. military forces â€” which can only be deployed to a handful of countries at most â€”if they can expel
or paralyze American diplomacy, support for U.S. businesses and investment, support for U.S. NG0s, and
effective U.S. military and security advisory efforts.
This threat is already all too real in far too many parts of the world, and it has effectively eliminated one of the
key differences between ""hard"" and ""soft"" power. ""Soft"" power cannot survive where it is not protected by
""hard"" power. Moreover, there are few if any crises cases where advice and aid in politics, governance,
economics and rule of law can be separated from a matching need for advice and aid in addressing military,
security, counterterrorism, and national police concerns.
In short, we do not need ""gotcha"" post-mortems or half-formed defenses. The tribute we really owe
Ambassador Chris Stevens is to undertake the following eight steps:
â€¢ Understand that diplomacy will often be a form of asymmetric warfare in crisis countries, particularly
those with crumbling regimes or new unstable governments. Accept the fact there can be no success
without taking increased risk and suffering casualties.
â€¢ Set realistic and achievable goals country-by-country and give the ambassador and country team as
much discretion as possible. Don't set impossible goals for instant democracy, human rights, rule of law
or stability. Accept the need for evolutionary action and ""doing it their way."" Don't try one size fits all
ideological solutions or efforts from Washington.
â€¢ Stop focusing on narrow budget cuts and examine the costs and benefits of effective, well-funded
country team efforts. If properly funded diplomacy and country team efforts only win support for the
U.S. in one crisis country over the next decade, or avoid even one armed intervention, they will still
more than pay for their costs in terms of the U.S. budget, and the overall effort will be immensely more
valuable in terms of gains (and tax revenues) in U.S. trade and investment.
â€¢ Reexamine how to create all of the elements of ""expeditionary diplomacy"" efforts, including strong
country teams, and the ability to suddenly boost teams in countries in crises, with the full range of tools
an ambassador needs. This includes adequate staff, operating and security funds, and flexible aid funds
that can be applied quickly to deal with changing needs and circumstances.
â€¢ Fully fund security but find the best ways to change existing procedures to emphasize mobility and
move to high-risk areas. Refocus intelligence to help reduce risks, and restructure protection efforts to
provide specially trained and equipped U.S. and foreign national security. Stop doing pointless security
post-mortem blame games and focus on the future.
â€¢ Reward and encourage necessary risk taking. Make it clear that this is a key part of a successful career
path, that it will be fully supported by State and other agencies deploying U.S. personnel, and reorient
security efforts in country to protect such efforts in the best ways possible rather than creating rules that
either make effective action impossible or force diplomats and advisors to violate such rules without
protection. Anyone who works with U.S. diplomats, aid workers, and military advisory teams overseas

knows that we have strong cadres ready and willing to take such risks. The challenge is to properly
support them in county and reward them for their service.
â€¢ Reexamine the insurance coverage, benefits, and salaries of such risk takers. Don't sustain the present
situation in Afghanistan and earlier in Iraq where contractors get massive wage increases and diplomats
and aid workers lack the full equivalent of combat pay and protection for them and their families if they
are killed or disabled. Ensure adequate lasting medical care for lasting injuries.
Finally, see if there is some way the U.S. Congress can address these issues realistically in a way that actually
focuses on U.S. national interests even in a time of petty partisan feeding frenzies. These efforts not only need
the next Administration to fully fund and support them at a time of growing budget pressures, they need
bipartisan support in both Houses of Congress.
There will be a need for outside review, for new reporting requirement and for hearings. But, they need to look
forward. U.S. efforts must serve national interests rather than personal or partisan advantage, accept the
complexity and time needed to deal with country-by-country efforts, and focus on pragmatic ways of dealing
with the future rather than dissecting the past.

Secretary Clinton's leadership on Libya
HRC has been a critical voice on Libya in administration deliberations, at NATO, and in contact group
meetings â€” as well as the public face of the U.S. effort in Libya. She was instrumental in securing the
authorization, building the coalition, and tightening the noose around Qadhafi and his regime.
February 25 â€” HRC announces the suspension of operations of the Libyan embassy in Washington.
February 26 â€” HRC directs efforts to evacuate all U.S. embassy personnel from Tripoli and orders the closing of
the embassy.
February 26 HRC made a series of calls to her counterparts to help secure passage of UNSC 1970, which
imposes sanctions on Gaddafi and his family and refers Qadhafi and his cronies to the ICC
February 28 â€” HRC travels to Geneva, Switzerland for consultations with European partners on Libya. She
gives a major address in which she says: ""Colonel Qadhafi and those around him must be held accountable for
these acts, which violate international legal obligations and common decency. Through their actions, they have
lost the legitimacy to govern. And the people of Libya have made themselves clear: It is time for Qadhafi to go
â€” now, without further violence or delay."" She also works to secure the suspension of Libya from membership

March 17â€” HRC secures Russian abstention and Portuguese and African support for UNSC 1973, ensuring that
it passes. 1973 authorizes a no-fly zone over Libya and ""all necessary measures"" - code for military action - to
protect civilians against Gaddafts army.
March 24 â€” HRC engages with allies and secures the transition of command and control of the civilian
protection mission to NATO. She announces the transition in a statement.

target Libya's air defenses.
March 29 â€” HRC travels to London for a conference on Libya, where she is a driving force behind the creation
of a Contact Group comprising 20-plus countries to coordinate efforts to protect civilians and plan for a post-
Qadhafi Libya. She is instrumental in setting up a rotating chair system to ensure regional buy-in.
April 14â€” HRC travels to Berlin for NATO meetings. She is the driving force behind NATO adopting a
communique that calls for Qadhafi's departure as a political objective, and lays out three clear military
objectives: end of attacks and threat of attacks on civilians; the removal of Qadhafi forces from cities they
forcibly entered; and the unfettered provision of humanitarian access.
May 5 â€” HRC travels to Rome for a Contact Group meeting. The Contact Group establishes a coordination
system and a temporary financial mechanism to funnel money to the TNC.
June 8 â€” HRC travels to Abu Dhabi for another Contact Group meeting and holds a series of intense discussions
with rebel leaders.
June 12 â€” HRC travels to Addis for consultations and a speech before the African Union, pressing the case for a
democratic transition in Libya.
July 15 â€” HRC travels to Istanbul and announces that the U.S. recognizes the TNC as the legitimate government
of Libya. She also secures recognition from the other members of the Contact Group.
Late June â€” HRC meets with House Democrats and Senate Republicans to persuade them not to de-fund the
Libya operation.
July 16 â€” HRC sends Feltman, Cretz, and Chollet to Tunis to meet with Qadhafi envoys ""to deliver a clear and
firm message that the only way to move forward, is for Qadhafi to step down"".
Early August â€” HRC works to construct a $1.5 billion assets package to be approved by the Security Council
and sent to the TNC. That package is working through its last hurdles.
Early August -- After military chief Abdel Fattah Younes is killed, S sends a personal message to TNC head
Jalil to press for a responsible investigation and a careful and inclusive approach to creating a new executive
council
Early August -- HRC secures written pledges from the TNC to an inclusive, pluralistic democratic
transition. She continues to consult with European and Arab colleagues on the evolving situation.

Subject: Rice on ""This Week""
Here is Susan on this week. She wasn't asked about whether we had any Intel. But she did make clear our
view that this started spontaneously and then evolved. The only troubling sentence relates to the
investigation, specifically: ""And we'll see when the investigation unfolds whether what was â€” what
transpired in Benghazi might have unfolded differently in different circumstances."" But she got pushed
there.
Waiting on other transcripts.
For more on what happened and why, lees bring in the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Dr. Susan
Rice. Dr. Rice, thank you for joining us.
RICE: Good to be with you, Jake.
TAPPER: So, first of all, what is the latest you can tell us on who these attackers were at the embassy or at
the consulate in Benghazi? We're hearing that the Libyans have arrested people. They're saying that some
people involved were from outside the country, that there might have even been Al Qaida ties. What's the
latest information?
RICE: Well, Jake, first of all, ifs important to know that there's an FBI investigation that has begun and
will take some time to be completed. That will tell us with certainty what transpired.
But our current best assessment, based on the information that we have at present, is that, in fact, what
this began as, it was a spontaneous -- not a premeditated â€” response to what had transpired in Cairo.In
Cairo, as you know, a few hours earlier, there was a violent protest that was undertaken in reaction to this
very offensive video that was disseminated.

We believe that folks in Benghazi, a small number of people came to the embassy to -- or to the consulate,
rather, to replicate the sort of challenge that was posed in Cairo. And then as that unfolded, it seems to
have been hijacked, let us say, by some individual clusters of extremists who came with heavier weapons,
weapons that as you know in -- in the wake of the revolution in Libya are -- are quite common and
accessible. And it then evolved from there.
We'll wait to see exactly what the investigation finally confirms, but that's the best information we have at
present.
TAPPER: Why was there such a security breakdown? Why was there not better security at the compound
in Benghazi? Why were there not U.S. Marines at the embassy in Tripoli?
RICE: Well, first of all, we had a substantial security presence with our personnel...
TAPPER: Not substantial enough, though, right?
RICE: ... with our personnel and the consulate in Benghazi. Tragically, two of the four Americans who
were killed were there providing security. That was their function. And indeed, there were many other
colleagues who were doing the same with them.
It obviously didn't prove sufficient to the -- the nature of the attack and sufficient in that -- in that
moment. And that's why, obviously, we have reinforced our remaining presence in Tripoli and why the
president has very -- been very clear that in Libya and throughout the region we are going to call on the
governments, first of all, to assume their responsibilities to protect our facilities and our personnel, and
we're reinforcing our facilities and our -- our embassies where possible...
TAPPER: But why...
RICE: ... and where needed.
TAPPER: Why would we not have Marines at the embassy in Tripoli to begin with? It would seem like this
-- this is obviously an unstable country. This is a region where U.S. interests have been attacked in
previous months. Why were there not Marines there to begin with?
RICE: First of all, there are Marines in some places around the world. There are not Marines in every
facility. That depends on the circumstances. That depends on the requirements. Our presence in Tripoli,
as in Benghazi, is relatively new, as you will recall. We've been back post-revolution only for a matter of
months.
But I've visited there myself, both to Tripoli and Benghazi. I was very grateful to have a strong security
presence with me as part of our -- our embassy detachment there. So we certainly are aware that Libya is a
place where there have been increasingly some violent incidents. The security personnel that the State

Department thought were required were in place. And we'll see when the investigation unfolds whether
what was -- what transpired in Benghazi might have unfolded differently in different circumstances.
But the president has been very clear. The protection of American personnel and facilities is and will
remain our top ptiority. That's why we've reinforced our presence in Tripoli and elsewhere.
TAPPER: Look at this map, if you would. There have been protests around the world over the last several
days. And President Obama pledged to repair America's relationships with the Muslim world. Why does
the U.S. seem so impotent? And why is the U.S. even less popular today in some of these Muslim and Arab
countries than it was four years ago?
RICE: Jake, we're not impotent. We're not even less popular, to challenge that assessment. I don't know
on what basis you make that judgment. But let me -- let me point...
TAPPER: It just seems that the U.S. government is powerless as this â€” as this maelstrom erupts.
RICE: It's actually the opposite. First of all, let's be clear about what transpired here. What happened this
week in Cairo, in Benghazi, in many other parts of the region...
TAPPER: Tunisia, Khartoum...
RICE: ... was a result -- a direct result of a heinous and offensive video that was widely disseminated, that
the U.S. government had nothing to do with, which we have made clear is reprehensible and disgusting.
We have also been very clear in saying that there is no excuse for violence, there is -- that we have
condemned it in the strongest possible terms.
But let's look at what's happened. It's quite the opposite of being impotent. We have worked with the
governments in Egypt. President Obama picked up the phone and talked to President Morsi in Egypt. And
as soon as he did that, the security provided to our personnel in our embassies dramatically increased.
President Morsi...
TAPPER: It took two days for President Morsi to say anything about this.
RICE: President Mani has been out repeatedly and said that he condemns this violence. He's called off â€”
and his people have called off any further demonstrations and have made very clear that this has to stop,
(CROSSTALK)
RICE: Now, and -- and same, frankly, in Tunisia, in Yemen, and, of course, in Libya, where the
government has -- has gone out of its way to try to step up security and express deepest remorse for what
has happened. We are quite popular in Libya, as you might expect, having been a major partner in their
revolution. What transpired outside of our consulate in Benghazi was not an expression of deep-seated

anti-Americanism on the part of the Libyan people. Quite the contrary. The counter-demonstrations, the
outpouring of sympathy and support for Ambassador Stevens and for the United States, the government
of Libya and -- and the people on the street saying how pained they are by this, is much more a reflection
of the sentiment towards the United States than a small handful of heavily armed mobsters.
TAPPER: That certainly, according to polling, is the case in Libya. Not the case in Egypt. And since you
brought up President Morsi, let me try to get some clarification on something. President Obama was asked
about the relationship with Egypt on Wednesday, and this is what he said.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
OBAMA: I don't think that we would consider them an ally, but we don't consider them an enemy. They
are a new government that is trying to find its way.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
TAPPER: The United States has sent billions of dollars of U.S. taxpayer money to Egypt over the last few
decades. And by definition, as you know, according to the State Department, Egypt is a major non-NATO
ally of the United States. Why would President Obama say Egypt is not an ally?
RICE: Well, first of all, the president has been very clear and -- and everybody understands that Egypt is a
very critical partner of the United States, has long been so. That relationship remains the same, and the
president wasn't signaling any change in -- in the nature...
TAPPER: Was he trying to nudge Morsi?
RICE: The president wasn't signaling any change in the nature of our relationship. Obviously, the
president had a conversation with President Morsi and a very productive one, in which he underscored
that it's, of course, the responsibility of the Egyptian government as host to protect diplomatic personnel
and facilities, including our own, and we saw that President Morsi, immediately after that, took dramatic
steps to improve the security of our facilities in Cairo and elsewhere, and then went out and repeatedly
made a number of very important and powerful statements condemning the violence and conveying the
message that, however hateful such a video may be, there is absolutely no justification for violence against
the United States or other Western partners.
So what we've seen is that the president has been incredibly calm, incredibly steady, and incredibly
measured in his approach to this set of developments. And his interventions, his leadership has ensured
that in Egypt, in Yemen, in Tunisia, in Libya, and many other parts of the world, that leaders have come
out and made very plain that there's no excuse for this violence. We heard Prime Minister Erdogan of
Turkey say the same, we heard the Grand Mufti in Saudi Arabia say the same, that there's no excuse for
violence, that violence is to be condemned, and that governments have a responsibility to protect United
States personnel and facilities and those of all foreign diplomats.

TAPPER: I know you have to go, but very quickly, was the president in that interview trying to nudge
President Morsi, ""Get your act together'?
RICE: No. I think that the president communicated directly with â€” with President Morsi and had the
opportunity to -- to understand our expectation that Egypt will do what it can to protect our facilities. So
that -- that was conveyed very directly, and the results were immediate and quite satisfactory.
TAPPER: Dr. Rice, thank you so much for coming here today and answering our questions.

Secretary Clinton's leadership on Libya
HRC has been a critical voice on Libya in administration deliberations, at NATO, and in contact group
meetings â€” as well as the public face of the U.S. effort in Libya. She was instrumental in securing the
authorization, building the coalition, and tightening the noose around Qadhafi and his regime.
February 25 â€” HRC announces the suspension of operations of the Libyan embassy in Washington.
February 26 â€” HRC directs efforts to evacuate all U.S. embassy personnel from Tripoli and orders the closing of
the embassy.
February 26 HRC made a series of calls to her counterparts to help secure passage of UNSC 1970, which
imposes sanctions on Gaddafi and his family and refers Qadhafi and his cronies to the ICC
February 28 â€” HRC travels to Geneva, Switzerland for consultations with European partners on Libya. She
gives a major address in which she says: ""Colonel Qadhafi and those around him must be held accountable for
these acts, which violate international legal obligations and common decency. Through their actions, they have
lost the legitimacy to govern. And the people of Libya have made themselves clear: It is time for Qadhafi to go
â€” now, without further violence or delay."" She also works to secure the suspension of Libya from membership
in the Human Rights Council.

March 29 - HRC travels to London for a conference on Libya, where she is a driving force behind the creation
of a Contact Group comprising 20-plus countries to coordinate efforts to protect civilians and plan for a post-
Qadhafi Libya. She is instrumental in setting up a rotating chair system to ensure regional buy-in.
April 14 - HRC travels to Berlin for NATO meetings. She is the driving force behind NATO adopting a
communiquÃ© that calls for Qadhafi's departure as a political objective, and lays out three clear military
objectives: end of attacks and threat of attacks on civilians; the removal of Qadhafi forces from cities they
forcibly entered; and the unfettered provision of humanitarian access.
May 5 - HRC travels to Rome for a Contact Group meeting. The Contact Group establishes a coordination
system and a temporary financial mechanism to funnel money to the TNC.
June 8 - HRC travels to Abu Dhabi for another Contact Group meeting and holds a series of intense discussions
with rebel leaders.
June 12 - HRC travels to Addis for consultations and a speech before the African Union, pressing the case for a
democratic transition in Libya.
July 15 - HRC travels to Istanbul and announces that the U.S. recognizes the TNC as the legitimate government
of Libya. She also secures recognition from the other members of the Contact Group.
Late June - HRC meets with House Democrats and Senate Republicans to persuade them not to de-fund the
Libya operation.
July 16 - HRC sends Feltrnan, Cretz, and Chollet to Tunis to meet with Qadhafi envoys ""to deliver a clear and
firm message that the only way to move forward, is for Qadhafi to step down"".
Early August - HRC works to construct a $1.5 billion assets package to be approved by the Security Council
and sent to the TNC. That package is working through its last hurdles.

Limited Security in Benghazi, Secrecy Over Safe House, Contributed to Tragedy
The U.S. Consulate in Benghazi under attack on Sept. 11. The deadly assault raised questions about security lapses and
misjudgments by U.S. officials.
The deadly assault on a U.S. diplomatic mission in Libya on Sept. 11 was preceded by a succession of security lapses and
misjudgments, compounded by fog-of-battle decisions, that raise questions about whether the scope of the tragedy
could have been contained.
U.S, officials issued alerts and ordered security precautions in neighboring Egypt ahead of protests and violence on Sept.
11, but largely overlooked the possibility of trouble at other diplomatic postings in the region.
The State Department chose to maintain only limited security in Benghazi, Libya, despite months of sporadic attacks
there on U.S. and other Western missions. And while the U.S. said it would ask Libya to boost security there, it did so just
once, for a one week period in June, according to Libyan officials.
The U.S. didn't seriously consider sending in the military during the attack. It summoned rapid-response teams of
Marines only after the U.S. ambassador was dead. State Department officials said they doubted the Pentagon could
have mobilized a rescue force quickly enough to make a difference during the fighting. The Pentagon waited for
guidance from State, which is responsible for diplomatic security, a senior military official said,

Adding a new dimension to the chain of events, the siege also engulfed what officials now describe as a secret safe
house used by American officials and security personnel involved in sensitive government programs after last year's
Libyan revolution.
Even when that building, also known as the ""annex,"" came under attack, U.S. officials were reluctant to divulge its
existence, and the secrecy complicated the Libyan response and the eventual American evacuation, according to Libyan
security officials.
The Obama administration has defended levels of security in place. Though intelligence officials are investigating
indications al Qaeda's North African affiliate had connections with militants who mounted the attack, U.S. officials say
the evidence still indicates it was a spontaneous response to protests in Cairo against an anti-Islamic video. But a
detailed review based on interviews with more than a dozen U.S. and Libyan officials shows months of ominous signals
suggesting the need for better security, along with missed chances for delivering it.
President Barack Obama, in his re-election campaign, gets high marks from voters on national security, but has drawn
Republican criticism over his handling of the anti-American protests.
After a classified briefing to lawmakers by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Thursday, Sen. Susan Collins (R., Maine)
called the security ""woefully inadequate, given the security-threat environment."" The State Department has convened
an Accountability Review Board to investigate the attack, something it is required to do after such an incident.
U.S. officials still are struggling to piece together details of the attack. For more than a week after U.S. Ambassador
Christopher Stevens was killed, the State Department couldn't say why he was in Benghazi. On Thursday, officials said
they believed he was there to attend the launch of a joint U.S.-Libyan cultural and educational program.
Mr. Stevens and Sean Smith, an information officer, were killed at the consulate, in the first wave of the attack. Former
Navy SEALs Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods died later, at the sensitive safe house or annex a kilometer away. It remains
unclear to U.S. and Libyan officials whether the militants knew of that facility or just followed a U.S. convoy to it after
the consulate attack.
The apparent lapses extended to firefighting equipment. Rescue attempts at the main building were thwarted in part by
the absence of smoke-protection masks and fire extinguishers, said Libyan guards. Senior State Department officials said
these wouldn't have provided sufficient protection against the diesel-fueled inferno.
State Department officials said security for the consulate was frequently reviewed and was deemed sufficient to counter
what U.S. officials considered to be the most likely threat at the time: a limited hit-and-run attack with rocket-propelled
grenades or improvised explosive devices, or IEDs.
There was a string of attacks in Benghazi in the months before Sept. 11, including a June 6 IED explosion outside.the
consulate compound. ""These types of incidents were the ones that were our principal concerns,"" a senior State
Department official said. Based on the outcome of the June 6 attack, in which a perimeter wall was damaged but no
Americans hurt, a second State Department official added: ""Our security plan worked.""
Current and former officials said the security choices in Benghazi reflected efforts by Mr. Stevens to maintain a low-
profile security posture and show faith in Libya's new leaders, despite questions about their ability to rein in heavily
armed bands of militants. Officials say Mr. Stevens personally advised against having Marines posted at the embassy in
Tripoli, apparently to avoid a militarized U.S. presence.
The security plan for the consulate also reflected confidence Mr. Stevens felt in a city where he worked for months with
rebels battling Moammar Gadhafi's rule. State Department officials said he didn't consult with Washington before
traveling to Benghazi, located in an area that has become notorious for its volatile mix of Islamist militancy and heavy
weaponry.

""This is what happens when you're relying on a government that's not in control of the whole country,"" said Randa
Fahmy Hudome, a former U.S. official. Benghazi ""was awash with weapons in the hands of various brigades who were all
in combat with one another. It wasn't a secret.""
A State Department official said Washington doesn't control the travels of ambassadors within countries where they are
posted. But some current and former U.S. officials say it was a mistake for the administration to put so much faith in the
Libyans to provide adequate security so soon after the revolution, and questioned why more robust contingency plans
weren't in place.
One senior State Department official described the Benghazi consulate as a ""temporary office"" that security officers
treated as a ""subsidiary"" of the embassy in Tripoli, where more strenuous procedures and precautions were in place. ""So
Tripoli had the plan and the idea was that these people would just fall back on Tripoli, which they did in this situation, so
it worked,"" the official said.
Alarm bells about security in Benghazi started sounding this spring.
On April 10, someone threw an explosive device at a convoy carrying United Nations envoy Ian Martin. On May 22, a
rocket-propelled grenade hit offices of the International Committee of the Red Cross.
After the June 6 IED attack on the U.S. consulate, the U.S. asked Libya to step up security around American installations,
said a State Department spokesman. Libyan officials say the request was only for one week. A State Department official
said the temporary security buildup was needed to repair damage to the wall.
The Libyan who received the request said the added security was two extra cars of men plus some heavy machine guns.
After the repairs, Libyan security returned to normal levels: a four-man team of armed guards protecting the perimeter
and four unarmed Libyan guards inside to screen visitors.
Tensions remained high, however. On June 11, a rocket-propelled grenade hit a convoy in Benghazi carrying Britain's
ambassador to Libya, injuring two bodyguards. Britain closed its consulate in Benghazi.
The U.S. deemed the security level sufficient and decided to stay, ""given the very important mission that we have in
eastern Libya to support U.S. national security interests,"" said a senior State Department official. He said ""robust""
security improvements had been made to the compound since the Americans moved into it in May 2011, including
cement barriers and barbed wire.
As the attacks mounted in Benghazi, intelligence agencies warned of the growing security risks, but didn't have specific
intelligence about particular threats or planned attacks. On Aug. 27, the State Department issued a travel warning for
Libya, citing a threat of assassinations and car bombings in both Benghazi and Tripoli. The warning said the embassy's
ability to intervene was limited because armed groups behind the attacks were ""neither sanctioned nor controlled by
the Libyan government.""
In the days before Sept. 11, intelligence agencies issued their annual warning of heightened security risks around the
anniversary of the 2001 attacks. Many counterterrorism officials saw a lessened risk this year than last year, which was
the 10th anniversary and the first one after the killing of Osama bin Laden.
In Libya, embassy personnel conducted a security review right before the anniversary. It determined there was no
reason to think an attack was planned or the consulate in Benghazi was ""insufficiently postured,"" said a senior
administration official.
Across the border in Egypt, red flags appeared on Sept. 8, after a radical Egyptian cleric aired on television portions of an
anti-Islam video believed made in the U.S. Officials at the U.S. embassy in Cairo that night sent the first of several
messages alerting Washington and other embassies in the region to the video and seeking guidance about responding
and the potential for a backlash.

The embassy in Cairo knew the film was beginning to get attention because it was monitoring social media, according to
State Department officials. ""That was well ahead of any intelligence that they got from Washington,"" one official said.
On Monday, Sept. 10, intelligence agencies sent a warning directly to the U.S. embassy in Cairo saying the protests could
turn violent. Diplomatic security officers in Cairo sent most embassy personnel home.
Intelligence analysts at the time had no reason to believe the unrest would spill over to neighboring Libya or beyond,
officials said. State Department officials likewise found no reason to put other embassies in the region on heightened
alert and decided not to call in Marine teams to help in Cairo.
""We have to put this in context: We've had protest after protest in Cairo. We know where the military is. We know
where to find them when we need them,"" a senior State Department official said.
Ethan Chorin, an American development economist working with U.S. and Libyan officials on a hospital in Benghazi, said
he spoke by phone to Mr. Stevens about an hour before the assault, and the ambassador told him there was ""no
indication of trouble"" following the protests in Egypt. Mr. Chorin said a subsequent conversation he had with the
ambassador's security officer was cut short by what the officer said was a serious problem. Several minutes later, he
could, hear explosions from his hotel room across town as the assault began.
During a final call by Mr. Chorin to a security officer at the consulate, the attack began, and his call was cut off.
The attack on the consulate compound started shortly after 9:30 p.m. Benghazi time, which was 3:30 p.m. Eastern time,
according to Libyan security guards.
Besides the four armed Libyans outside, five armed State Department diplomatic security officers were at the consulate.
Diplomatic security agent David Ubben was inside the main building with Mr. Stevens and Mr. Smith, the information-
management officer, when the attack,ers set it on fire around 15 minutes after the shooting started.
The three took refuge in a safe room, but found themselves overcome by smoke and agreed they would make a break
for it through a window, according to a State Department official familiar with Mr. Ubben's role.
Mr. Ubben, a 30-year-old Iraq war veteran, managed to escape, but lost contact with Messrs. Stevens and Smith in the
dense smoke, the official said.
In Washington, officials said, National Security Adviser Tom Donilon informed Mr. Obama of the attack in progress
ahead of a 5 p.m. Eastern time Oval Office meeting with Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and Gen. Martin Dempsey,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. By then, the main villa in the consulate compound was on fire.
There was no serious consideration at that hour of intervening with military force, officials said. Doing so without Libya's
permission could represent a violation of sovereignty and inflame the situation, they said. Instead, the State Department
reached out to the Libyan government to get reinforcements to the scene.
The Libyans sent about two dozen security men, according to members of the reinforcement team, who arrived at the
consulate 30 minutes after the fighting had started.
In addition to the shooting, thick black smoke and flames hindered a proper search inside the consulate, an effort
further hampered by the absence of fire extinguishers and masks.
Mr. Ubben and the other security agents made several trips into the building to try to find the diplomats but could
spend only brief periods inside, and suffered varying degrees of lung damage, said the official familiar with Mr. Ubben's
role.

On one trip in, they found Mr. Smith's body and pulled it out. There was no sign of the ambassador.
The American security personnel evacuated the consulate and made their way to the secret site called the annex.
A plane with an American security team from Tripoli arrived in Benghazi about 1:30 a.m., according to the Libyan
account. The team found its way to the annex using global positioning devices. Libyans who accompanied the Americans
to the scene weren't told of the annex's location because of its connection to sensitive programs, and the Americans
didn't give them the GPS coordinates or address. Libyans at an emergency operation center in Benghazi were also kept
in the dark to the exact location.
As the U.S. and Libyan reinforcement team arrived from the airport, fighting broke out at the annex.
That assault, using rocket-propelled grenades and mortars, was described in U.S. and Libyan accounts as more
sophisticated than the earlier attack on the consulate, and it appeared to involve militants with possible links to al
Qaecla.
The Libyans led a convoy of roughly 30 Americans from the safe house to the airport, where a plane had been waiting.
But they quickly realized the plane was too small to evacuate everyone at once.
""We were surprised at the numbers of Americans who were at the airport,"" said Libyan Deputy Prime Minister Mustafa
Abushagour. ""We figured three or four people. No one told us the numbers ahead of time.""
The deputy prime minister said that he learned about the extent of U.S. intelligence operations only after the incident.
We have no problem with intelligence sharing or gathering, but our sovereignty is also key,"" said Mr. Abushagour.
The first to be flown to Tripoli were American diplomats and civilians. The U.S. security team waited for a second flight.
During the wait, Libyan troops went, without any Americans, to the Benghazi Medical Center to retrieve the
ambassador's body. Around 8 a.m., according to Libyan officials, the security detail flew back to Tripoli, carrying the
body.
Some officials say the U.S. could have sent military forces to Benghazi from U.S. Naval Air Station Sigonella, which is
some 450 miles away in Sicily, or mobilized a Marine team in Rota, Spain. Some officials said the U.S. could also have
sent aircraft to the scene in a ""show of force"" to scare off the attackers.
State Department officials dismissed the suggestions as unrealistic. ""They would not have gotten there in two hours,
four hours or six hours. They don't have troops sitting in a room next to an airplane with a pilot just sitting in the next
room drinking coffee,"" one senior State Department official said.
Some defense officials agreed with that assessment, given limited communications to Americans on the ground during
the assault. ""It was the fog of war,"" one said.
At the annex, Mr. Ubben suffered head and leg injuries from a mortar explosion. He was released this week from
intensive care but remains at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, in Bethesda, Md., the State Department
official familiar with his role said.
Mr. Ubben, a Marylander, is married and has a stepdaughter and an infant son. He is conscious and able to
communicate, according to his father, Rex Ubben.
""He's in good spirits,"" the senior Mr. Ubben said. ""They're pretty confident that he'll be able to walk again.""

Libyans march against Islamist militias in Benghazi
By Peter Graff and Suleiman Al-Khalidi
BENGHAZI, Libya Fri Sep 21, 2012 2:23prn EDT
(Reuters) - Thousands of Libyans marched in Benghazi on Friday in support of democracy and against the
Islamist militias that Washington blames for an attack on the U.S. consulate last week that killed four
Americans including the ambassador.
The ""Rescue Benghazi day"" demonstration called for the government to disband armed groups that have refused
to give up their weapons since the NATO-backed revolution that toppled Muammar Gaddafi last year,
Marchers headed for a main square where a much smaller counter demonstration of hundreds of supporters of
hardline Islamist group Ansar al-Sharia were waiting.
""It's obvious that this protest is against the militias. All of them should join the army or security forces as
individuals, not as groups,"" medical student Ahmed Sanallah, 27, said. ""Without that there will be no prosperity
and no success for the new Libya.""
The late afternoon demonstration had a cheerful atmosphere as families marched with small children on their
shoulders.
Fighter jets and helicopters roared overhead in a show of official support for the demonstration, which has been
enthusiastically promoted by the city's authorities.
""Those military battalions that want to impose their ideology on the people of Libya will be confronted,"" Saleh
Gaouda, a member of new ruling national congress, said.
""This city wants to go back to stability and participate in building the state""
In a sign of the cheerful atmosphere, one ear had a giant cardboard model of Benghazi's landmark lighthouse
strapped to the roof As the sun set and the crowd began to disperse, someone shot fireworks into the air.

""DEFEND BENGHAZI""
Although the main demands of the marchers did not mention the attack on the U.S. consulate, it seems to have
provided a strong impetus for the authorities to rally support behind the country's weak government.
U.S. ambassador Christopher Stevens was well liked in Libya, and many people who were angered by an anti-
Islamic film made in the United States consider the attack on the embassy to have been excessive. Some
placards in English, intended for international news cameras, read: ""We demand justice for Stevens"" and ""Libya
lost a friend"".
""1 am out today to defend Benghazi. Killing the ambassador is a completely separate thing,"" 26-year-old Arnjad
Mohammed Hassan, a network engineer, said ""I don't give a damn about the killing of the ambassador because
the Americans offended the Prophet. I am just here for Benghazi.""
Benghazi, 1,000 km (600 miles) from Tripoli across largely empty desert, is controlled by various armed
groups, including some comprised of Islamists who openly proclaim their hostility to democratic government
and the West.
Some of these have been identified by local people as being among those who were at the consulate protest last
week. U.S. officials have described the violence as a ""terrorist attack"".
One group linked to the attack is Ansar al-Shatia, which has denied involvement in the violence.
Abu Al-Qaa, a demonstrator at the Ansar al-Sharia counter demonstration, said Stevens ""was preparing for he
entry of American troops into Libya"".
""The will of the Prophet was to expel infidels from Muslim lands so that Muslims prevail. Terrorizing your
enemy is one of Islam's tenets."" ,
He said he had fought against American troops in Iraq where he was arrested and sent back to Gaddafi's Libya
and jailed for three years.
One banner at that demonstration read: ""Day to rescue Benghazi or day to rescue America?""
In southern Libya, at least six people were killed and 12 injured in clashes between security forces and a local
group, a security official and a resident said on Friday.
Security forces were sent to the town of Brak, 700 km (400 miles) south of Tripoli, on Wednesday to stop a
group broadcasting songs about Craddafi on the radio, the official said The security forces, made up of former

Subject: UPDATE: Libyan Islamist says he was at U.S. consulate during attack (Reuters)
BENGHAZI (Reuters) - A Libyan militia commander who U.S officials say is under investigation in connection
with the attacks on the American consulate in Benghazi which led to the death of the ambassador said he was
present during the incident but was not one of the ringleaders.
Some American newspapers have quoted unnamed Libyan officials as pointing to Ahmed Abu Khattala as
the leader of the attacks on Sept, 11. The newspapers also reported that the officials said Abu Khattala's
whereabouts were unknown.
U.S. government sources told Reuters that Abu Khattala is being investigated as a suspect in the Benghazi
consulate attacks though U.S. investigators are not clear at this point if he played a role in leading or organising
the attacks.
In an interview, Abu Khattala told Reuters he had only heard he was a suspect through news media and was
surprised that officials had told journalists he was at large.
""These reports say that no one knows where I am and that I am hiding,"" he said. ""But here I am in the open,
sitting in a hotel with you I'm even going to pick up my sister's kids from school soon.""
Sitting with a friend in the restaurant of a Benghazi hotel, the 41-year-old, sporting a red felt hat and a full
salt-and-pepper beard, laughed gently.
""There were many people there from Ansar al-Shariah, from other brigades and from the general public,"" the
official, who refused to be named, said, referring to the hardline Islamist militia group which has been blamed
for the attack.
""Just because someone is there doesn't mean they were behind it.""
Abu Khattala denied being a leader of Ansar al-Shariah, but said he was friendly with the group and knew its
membership well.
A U.S. official said there may be more than person taking a lead role in the group.
""Ansar al-Shariah is a factionalised militant group without one home address,"" the official told Reuters.
""There may be several military commanders playing a role in its activities.""
Abu Khattala said that on the night of Sept 11, he received a phone call telling him that an attack on the U.S.

consulate was in progress and that he then went to the scene.
""I arrived at the street parallel to the consulate and waited for other brigade leaders to show me the way to
the buildings,"" he said. ""I arrived at the scene just like the others did -- to see what was happening.""
He said that after he arrived at the consulate, he began to help direct traffic with other militia leaders.
""People were crashing into each other because of the chaos and there was sporadic shooting,"" he said.
Abu Khattala said he called the commanders of Benghazi's security forces -- the February 17 brigade and the
Supreme Security Committee -- and told them to remove their cars and people from the consulate to avoid
clashes.
""Soon after I made my calls, one of the guards told me that four men were detained in a building inside the
compound who had been shooting at the demonstrators,"" he said.
""By the time I arrived at the building the men had already escaped. At that point I left the scene and didn't
return.""
Little is known about Abu Khattala, who hails from Benghazi.
Abu Khattala, who is unmarried, said he went to public schools in Libya but did not attend university or
community college. He said he was imprisoned for a total of 10 years for ""knowing suspected personalities"". He
refused to elaborate.
""I've also never left the country,"" he said when asked if he received any education or training abroad.
Abu Khattala said he formed the Obeidah al-Jarrah brigade at the beginning of the armed revolt which
toppled Muammar Gaddafi last year.
The shadowy armed militia was blamed in the killing last July of military chief Abdelfattah Younes, a
former Gaddafi loyalist who had defected to the rebels.
Younes was involved in the 1969 coup that brought Gaddafi to power. He was interior minister before he
defected and took a senior position in the rebellion in February.
Some rebels, especially hard-line conservative Islamist fighters who were persecuted under Gaddafi, were
never happy to serve under a man who had been so close to Gaddafi.
Abu Khattala was questioned by Libyan authorities but released because no evidence directly linked him to
the killing. He said he later broke up his militia group.
""After the revolution Obeidah al-Jarrah was disbanded because we were a fighting group and the war was
over in Benghazi,"" he said.
But many members of Obeidah al-Jarrah are known to have joined other brigades, including Ansar al-
Shariah in Benghazi.

Associated Press
Published September 21, 2012
BENGHAZI, lli3YA â€” Hundreds of protesters angry over last week's killing of the U.S. ambassador to Libya stormed the
compound of the Islamic extremist militia suspected in the attack, evicting militiamen and setting fire to their building
Friday.
In an unprecedented show of public anger at Libya's rampant militias, the crowd overwhelmed the compound of the
Ansar Al-Sharlah Brigade in the center of the eastern city of Benghazi.
Ansar Al-Shariah fighters initially fired in the air to disperse the crowd, but eventually abandoned the site with their
weapons and vehicles after it was overrun by waves of protesters shouting ""No to militias.""
""I don't want to see armed men wearing Afghani-style clothes stopping me in the street to give me orders, I only want to
see people in uniform,"" said Omar Mohammed, a university student who took part in the takeover of the site, which
protesters said was done in support of the army and police.
No deaths were reported in the incident, which came after tens of thousands marched in Benghazi against armed
militias. One vehicle was also burned at the compound.
For many Libyans, the Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi was the last straw in one of the biggest
problems Libya has faced since the ouster and death of longtime dictator Moamrnar Qaddafi around a year ago -- the
multiple mini-armies that with their arsenals of machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades are stronger than the
regular armed forces and police.
The militias, a legacy of the rag-tag popular forces that fought Qaddafi's regime, tout themselves as protectors of Libya's
revolution, providing security where police cannot. But many say they act like gangs, detaining and intimidating rivals
and carrying out killings.
Militias made up of Islamic radicals like Ansar Al-Shariah are notorious for attacks on Muslims who don't abide by their
hardline ideology. Officials and witnesses say fighters from Ansar Al-Shariati led the attack on the U.S. consulate, which
killed Amb. Chris Stevens and three other Americans.
After taking over the Ansar compound, protesters then drove to attack the Benghazi headquarters of another Islamist
militia, Rafallah Sahati. The militiamen opened fire on the protesters, who were largely unarmed. At least 20 were
wounded, and there were unconfirmed witness reports of three protesters killed.
Earlier in the day, some 30,000 people filled a broad boulevard as they marched along a lake in central Benghazi on
Friday to the gates of the headquarters of Ansar Al-Shariah.
""No, no, to militias,"" the crowd chanted, filling a broad boulevard. They carried banners and signs demanding that
militias disband and that the government build up police to take their place in keeping security. ""Benghazi is in a trap,""
signs read. ""Where is the army, where is the police?""

Other signs mourned the killing of Stevens, reading, ""The ambassador was Libya's friend"" and ""Libya lost a friend.""
Military helicopters and fighter jets flew overhead, and police mingled in the crowd, buoyed by the support of the
protesters.
The march was the biggest seen in Benghazi, Libya's second largest city and home to 1 million people, since the fall of
Qaddafi in August 2011. The public backlash comes in part in frustration with the interim government, which has been
unable to rein in the armed factions. Many say that officials' attempts to co-opt fighters by paying them have only fueled
the growth of militias without bringing them under state control or integrating them into the regular forces.
Residents of another main eastern city, Darna, have also begun to stand up against Ansar Al-Shariah and other militias.
The anti-militia fervor in Darna is notable because the city, in the mountains along the Mediterranean coast north of
Benghazi, has long had a reputation as a stronghold for Islamic extremists. During the Qaddafi era, it was the hotbed of a
deadly Islamist insurgency against his regime.
A significant number of the Libyan jihadists who travelled to Afghanistan and Iraq during recent wars came from Darna.
During the revolt against him last year, Qaddafi's regime warned that Darna would declare itself an Islamic Emirate and
ally itself with Al Qaeda.
But now, the residents are lashing out against Ansar Al-Shariah, the main Islamic extremist group in the city.
""The killing of the ambassador blew up the situation. It was disastrous,"" said Ayoub al-Shedwi, a young bearded Muslim
preacher in Darna who says he has received multiple death threats because has spoken out against militias on a radio
show he hosts. ""We felt that the revolution is going in vain.""
Leaders of tribes, which are the strongest social force in eastern Libya, have come forward to demand that the militias
disband.
Tribal leaders in Benghazi and Darna announced this week that members of their tribes who are militiamen will no
longer have their protection in the face of anti-militia protests. That means the tribe will not avenge them if they are
killed.
Activists and residents have held a sit-in for the past eight days outside Darna's Sahaba Mosque, calling on tribes to put
an end to the ""state of terrorism"" created by the militias.
Militiamen have been blamed for a range of violence in Darna. On the same day Stevens killed in Benghazi, a number of
elderly Catholic nuns and a priest who have lived in Darna for decades providing free medical services, were attacked,
reportedly beaten or stabbed. There have been 32 killings over the past few months, including the city security chief and
assassinations of former officers from Qaddafi's military.
Darna's residents are conservative, but they largely don't fit the city's reputation as extremists.
Women wear headscarves, but not the more conservative black garb and veil that covers the entire body and face. In
the ancient city's narrow alleys, shops display sleeveless women dresses and the young men racing by in cars blare
Western songs.
And many are impatient with Ansar Al-Sharjah's talk of imposing its strict version of Islamic law. The group's name
means ""Supporters of Shariah Law.""
""We are not infidels for God sake, We have no bars, no discos, we are not practicing vice in the street,"" said Wassam ben
Madin, a leading activist in the city who lost his right eye in clashes with security forces on the first day of the uprising
against Qaddafi. ""This is not the time for talk about Sharjah. Have a state first then talk to me about Sharjah.""

""If they are the 'supporters of Sharjah' then who are we?"" he said. ""We don't want the flag of Al Qaeda raised over
heads,"" he added, referring to Ansar Al-Shariah's black banner.
One elder resident at the Sahaba Mosque sit-in, Ramadan Yousset said, ""We will talk to them peacefully. We will tell
them you are from us and you fought for us"" during the civil war against Qaddafi. But 'if you say no (to integrating into
the) police and army, we will storm your place. It's over.""
Officials in the interim government and security forces say they are not strong enough to crack down on the militias. The
armed factions have refused government calls for them to join the regular army and police.
So the government has created a ""High Security Committee"" aimed at grouping the armed factions as a first step to
integration, Authorities pay fighters a salary of as much as 1,000 dinars, around $900, to join -- compared to the average
police monthly salary of around $200.
However, the militias that join still do not abide by government authority, and critics say the lure of salaries has only
prompted more militias to form.
Officials and former rebel commanders estimate the number of rebels that actually fought in the 8-month civil war
against Gadhafi at around 30,000. But those now listed on the High Security Committee payroll have reached several
hundred thousand.
""All these militia and entities are fake ones but it is mushrooming,"" said Khaled Hadar, a Benghazi-based lawyer. 'The
government is only making temporarily solutions, but you are creating a disaster.""

Re: Latest Libyan Leadership Private Discussions Sz Plans
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the
highest levels of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1.During mid-October 2012 Libyan President Yussef el Magariaf stated in private that he and
Prime Minister Ali Zidan have ordered National Libyan Army (NLA) Chief of Staff General Youssef al
Mangoush to establish a more coordinated operational relationship with Misrata and Zintan militias
in order to support expanded army operations throughout the country. According to a sensitive
source, prior to the death of the United States Ambassador on September ii, 2012 Mangoush resisted
greater reliance on these specific large militias, believing that such a move undercuts the
government's efforts to disarm and demobilize all of the militias left over from the 2011 civil war. At
this point, however, Mangoush agreed with Magariaf that the situation in the country is becoming
increasingly dangerous and unmanageable. Accordingly, the Chief of Staff stated that he will work
with Ousama al Jouwali, the leader of the Zintan forces to step up operations against the other
militias, (supported by the Misrata troops), that also come from the mountainous region of Western
Libya. At the same time he will instruct NLA troops under ground force commander General Khalifa
Belgasirn Haftar to pursue operations against tribal forces fighting on behalf of the Qaddafi family in
Southern and Southeastern Libya.
2. (Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, Magariaf and Zidan agree that Libya's
future depends on the success of their efforts in this militia demobilization operation over the next six
months. While they believe that the involvement of Ansar al Sharia forces, with the assistance of al
Qai'da in the Islamic Magreb (AQIM), in the assassination of the U.S. Ambassador has focused the
world business and diplomatic community on the reality of the security issues surrounding the
militias, the President and Prime Minister also fear that the situation is far worse than Western

sources realize. Mangoush informs them that AQIM and radical Salafist groups are increasing their
efforts to take advantage of the frustrations of the various militias with the government, using the
attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi as an inspiration for their activities. Just as Ansar al Sharia
began as a militia supporting the federalist claims of Eastern tribal leaders, and was then infiltrated
by AQIM radicals, Mangoush believes many of the other regional and ethnic militias around the
country could follow the same path, if his troops do not succeed in the disarmament program. He
also agrees with Zidan that they must move quickly since Libya's tradition of avoiding the Sunni-Shia
conflict that dominates most of Middle East is beginning to erode during this period of chaos.)
3. A particularly sensitive source noted that NLA operations have already begun against Ansar
al Sharia forces south of Benghazi, after members of that militia/terrorist group killed four national
policemen during a grenade attack at a roadblock in the Sousa Mountains. Under orders from Haftar
Libyan troops surrounded more than 100 Ansar al Sharia fighters in the region of the town of Sousa.
According to this sensitive source, the NLA suffered relatively heavy casualties in the fighting, but
believe they captured a number of AQIM operatives and one of Ansar al Sharia's senior commanders,
Sufian bin Qamu, who they believe ordered the attack on the police. Mangoush also reported to Zidan
that Qamu had been previously captured by United States forces and imprisoned at the Guantanamo
Bay facility.
4. At the same time the Libyan army and forces from the Misrata militia entered the town of
Bani Walid approximately 100 miles south of Tripoli, in an area still loyal to the Qaddafi family,
engaging in close fighting with pro-Qaddafi forces. During the fighting Haftar dispatched troops with
heavier arms to support the Misrata forces. According to this source, the NLA downplayed the level of
the fighting, in an effort to reassure the supporters of the Government. That said the NLA/Misrata
force had captured the city center and the airport after suffering significant casualties. The
Government forces entered the city after shelling opposition positions around the city hospital, using
heavy mortars and motorized guns.
5. (Source Comment: In the opinion of this knowledgeable individual, while Magariaf and
Zidan remain optimistic about the future of Libya, they believe that the security situation will remain
tenuous throughout 2013. Magariaf also sees the national election scheduled for mid-2013 as a
potentially complicating factor. According to this source, Mangoush and Haftar focused on Bani
Walid under pressure from the Misrata commanders. These militia leaders were, according to a
knowledgeable source, angered over the death of one of their senior officials, Omran Shahan, at the
hands of pro-Qaddafi forces in Bani Walid. The Misrata commanders report that Shaban was one of
the organizers of the Misrata militia unit that captured and executed Qaddafi in 2011 outside of the
town of Sirte. The Misrata leaders, supported by the General National Council (GNC), demanded the
surrender of the men who arrested and killed Shahan. As the fighting expanded through late
September and early October, Magariaf and his advisors came to see Bani Walid as an important
symbol of their commitment to disarm the militias and anti-government groups, and increased their
involvement accordingly.)

September 11, 2012 Mangoush resisted greater reliance on these specific large militias, believing
that such a move undercuts the government's efforts to disarm and demobilize all of the militias
left over from the 2011 civil war. At this point, however, Mangoush agreed with Magariaf that
the situation in the county is becoming increasingly dangerous and unmanageable.
Accordingly, the Chief of Staff stated that he will work with Ousama al Jouwali, the leader of the
Zintan forces to step up operations against the other militias, (supported by the Misrata troops),
that also come from the mountainous region of Western Libya. At the same time he will instruct
NLA troops under ground force commander General Khalifa Belgasim Haftar to pursue
operations against tribal forces fighting on behalf of the Qaddafi family in Southern and
Southeastern Libya.
2. (Source Comment In the opinion of this individual, Magariaf and Ziclan agree that
Libya's future depends on the success of their efforts in this militia demobilization operation
over the next six months. While they believe that the involvement of Ansar al Sharia forces,
with the assistance of al Qai'cla in the Islamic Magrelâ€¢ (AQIM), in the assassination of the U.S
Ambassador has focused the world business and diplomatic community on the reality of the
security issues surrounding the militias, the President and Prime Minister also fear that the
situation is far worse than Western sources realize Mangoush informs them that AQIM and
radical Salafist groups are increasing their efforts to take advantage of the frustrations of the
various militias with the government, using the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi as an
inspiration for their activities Just as Ansar al Sharia began as a militia supporting the federalist

3. A particularly sensitive source noted that NLA operations have already begun against
Ansar al Sharia forces south of Benghazi, after members of that militia/terrorist group killed four
national policemen during a grenade attack at a roadblock in the Sousa Mountains. Under orders
from flaftar Libyan troops surrounded more than 100 Ansar al Sharia fighters in the region of the
town of Sousa. According to this sensitive source, the NLA suffered relatively heavy casualties
in the fighting, but believe they captured a number of AQIM operatives and one of Ansar al
Sharia's senior commanders, Sufian bin Qamu, who they believe ordered the attack on the
police. Mangoush also reported to Zidan that Qamu had been previously captured by United
States forces and imprisoned at the Guantanamo Bay facility.
4. At the same time the Libyan army and forces from the Misrata militia entered the
town of Bani Walid approximately 100 miles south of Tripoli, in an area still loyal to the Qaddafi
family, engaging in close fighting with pro-Qaddafi forces. During the fighting Haftar
dispatched troops with heavier arms to support the Misrata forces. According to this source, the
NLA downplayed the level of the fighting, in an effort to reassure the supporters of the
Government. That said the NLAJMisrata force had captured the city center and the airport after
suffering significant casualties. The Government forces entered the city after shelling opposition
positions around the city hospital, using heavy mortars and motorized guns

focused on Bani Walid under pressure from the Misrata commanders. These militia leaders
were, according to a knowledgeable source, angered over the death of one of their senior
officials, Omran Shaban, at the hands of pro-Qaddafi forces in Bani Walk]. The Misrata
commanders report that Shaban was one of the organizers of the Misrata militia unit that
captured and executed Qaddafi in 2011 outside of the town of Sirte. The Misrata leaders,
supported by the General National Council (GNC), demanded the surrender of the men who
arrested and killed Shaban. As the fighting expanded through late September and early October,
Magariaf and his advisors came to see Bani Walid as an important symbol of their commitment
to disarm the militias and anti-government groups, and increased their involvement accordingly.)

The world after Petraeus
Obama should seize this chance to adjust his foreign policy.
By Sarah Chayes
November 15, 2012
The scandal enveloping members of America's adulated top brass is the deepest crisis to hit the military in
decades. It is a crisis President Obama did not need â€” shaming the country and increasing his burden during a
major transition on his national security team. And yet, crisis can be a great corrective. Obama should use this
one to reverse one of the most dysfunctional elements of U.S. foreign policy over the last decade: an infatuation
with military solutions to problems that are fundamentally political.
The resignation of former Central Intelligence Agency Director David H. Petraeus after an extramarital affair
came to light, together with expected high-level personnel changes at the State Department and other agencies,
creates a singular opportunity to embark on the complex process of rebalancing U.S. foreign policy in favor of
non-military approaches.
When he first came to office, Obama seemed suspicious of Petraeus, who made his reputation under President
George W. Bush as the general who transformed the military's approach to the Iraq war. The suspicion was
reflected in the fraught National Security Council debate over Afghanistan strategy in 2009. Yet since then,
Obama, like so many others, seems to have been seduced by Petraeus. Not by the man but by what the man
could offer him.
Petraeuss unique political genius over the last decade has been to provide each of two contrasting presidents a
military solution to his key national security problems that was tailored to his character. For Bush, obsessed
with Iraq and with leaving a mark on the Middle East, Petraeus helped design a grandiose, troop-heavy
approach.
With the change of administrations, Petraeus soon saw that Obama and his team were different â€” concerned
about the costs of the inherited wars and about the risks of a runaway military. So while Petraeus continued to
pay lip-service to counterinsurgency doctrine, he veered away from it in practice. His focus as commander of

the troops in Afghanistan â€” and even more so at the CIA â€” was on a type of warfare better suited to this
president: targeted, technologically advanced, secretive killing over which the president could exert control.
But such an approach, though cheaper in resources and American lives, is still flawed. It is still a military
answer to problems that are deeply political in nature and rooted in a complex mix of history, regional and
cultural particularism, and the effects of a protracted abuse of power by elites. By shifting to drones and special
ops as the instruments of choice to combat militant extremism, the U.S. government remains consumed by the
same old questions: How many men and women in uniform, equipped with what kind of hardware, need to
employ which tactics to defeat the enemy?
What atrophied during the years that two U.S. administrations dwelt obsessively on these questions were all the
other tools of U.S. foreign policy, including information-gathering and analysis, diplomacy and economic and
legal leverage.
Perhaps the gravest consequence has been the knowledge deficit. Both wars were hampered by a devastating
lack of situational understanding. In Afghanistan, where I lived and worked for more than eight years, I was
stunned by how long it took U.S. officials to realize that tribes were key to Afghan social structure. U.S.
officials resisted meeting with ordinary Afghans, dealing instead with members of a self-serving and unpopular
government. So, for more than a decade, the U.S. government was operating almost blind.
The first way Obama can constructively harness Petraeus downfall is to reorient the CIA toward its core
function: intelligence-gathering. Of late, a body-count culture has prevailed at the CIA, exemplified by the
secretive drone campaign. If 60 intelligence professionals are assigned to planning and monitoring each drone
in the air, as has been reported, that's 60 who are not on the ground in country, interacting with locals, gaining
an intuitive feel for the dynamics. Obama should resist the temptation to put another target-focused operator at
the helm of the CIA.
Another main civilian component of U.S. power is its diplomacy. Obama should also use this moment of
transition to think through what kind of State Department he really needs. The instruments of U.S. foreign
policy are multiple, varied and subtle in their application. To avail itself of them, the government needs smart,
adaptable, dynamic risk-takers, who think strategically and operate with autonomy. Such people must be
attracted to government service and provided responsibilities commensurate with their talents.
But the other national security topic of the moment threatens to push Obama in the wrong direction. The death
of Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens in Benghazi, Libya, has been politicized in deeply counterproductive
ways. Members of Congress should bear that in mind as they continue examining the details of the attack.
Stevens was exactly the type of diplomat the U.S. government needs: someone with long experience in the
region to which he was posted, an ambassador who engaged with people, gained insight into the environment
and helped influence it. That kind of diplomacy is essential, but it carries risks. If it becomes politically
untenable in Washington for an ambassador to die in the line of duty, then talented diplomats will be hobbled.
And faced with a choked career path, the best will look elsewhere for rewarding work. Obama should appoint a
secretary of State determined to counteract the tendency to retrench.
Perhaps the most important foreign policy challenge Obama faces in his second term is how to expand,
restructure and reinforce the range of civilian instruments of U.S. power. That is a generational task, but one the
current crisis has provided an unparalleled opportunity to tackle.

this point, however, Mangoush agreed with Magariaf that the situation in the country is becoming
increasingly dangerous and unmanageable. Accordingly, the Chief of Staff stated that he will work
with Ousama al Jouwali, the leader of the Zintan forces to step up operations against the other
militias, (supported by the Misrata troops), that also come from the mountainous region of Western
Libya. At the same time he will instruct NLA troops under ground force commander General Khalifa
Belgasina Haftar to pursue operations against tribal forces fighting on behalf of the Qaddafi family in

2- (Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, Magariaf and Zidan agree that Libya's
future depends on the success of their efforts in this militia demobilization operation over the next six
months. While they believe that the involvement of Ansar al Sharia forces, with the assistance of al
Qafda in the Islamic Magreb (AQIM), in the assassination of the U.S. Ambassador has focused the
world business and diplomatic community on the reality of the security issues surrounding the
militias, the President and Prime Minister also fear that the situation is far worse than Western
sources realize. Mangoush informs them that AQIM and radical Salafist groups are increasing their
efforts to take advantage of the frustrations of the various militias with the government, using the
attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi as an inspiration for their activities. Just as Amax al Sharia
began as a militia supporting the federalist claims of Eastern tribal leaders, and was then infiltrated
by NEVI radicals, Mangoush believes many of the other regional and ethnic militias around the
country could follow the same path, if his troops do not succeed in the disarmament program. Be
also agrees with Zidan that they must move quickly since Libya's tradition of avoiding the Sunni-Shia
conflict that dominates most of Middle East is beginning to erode during this period of chaos.)
3. A particularly sensitive source noted that NLA operations have already begun against Ansar
al Sharia forces south of Benghazi, after members of that militia/terrorist group killed four national
policemen during a grenade attack at a roadblock in the Sousa Mountains. Under orders from Haftar
Libyan troops surrounded more than 100 Ansar al Sharia fighters in the region of the town of Sousa.
According to this sensitive source, the NIA suffered relatively heavy casualties in the fighting, but
believe they captured a number of AQIM operatives and one of Ansar al Sharia's senior commanders,
Sufian bin Qamu, who they believe ordered the attack on the police. Mangoush also reported to Zidan
that Qamu had been previously captured by United States forces and imprisoned at the Guantanamo
Bay facility.
4. At the same time the Libyan army and forces from the Misrata militia entered the town of
Bani Walid approximately 100 miles south of Tripoli, in an area still loyal to the Qaddafi family,
engaging in close fighting with pro-Qaddafi forces. During the fighting Haftar dispatched troops with
heavier arms to support the Misrata forces. According to this source, the NLA downplayed the level of
the fighting, in an effort to reassure the supporters of the Government. That said the NLA/Misrata
force had captured the city center and the airport after suffering significant casualties. The
Government forces entered the city after shelling opposition positions around the city hospital, using
heavy mortars and motorized guns.
5. (Source Comment: In the opinion of this knowledgeable individual, while Magariaf and
Zidan remain optimistic about the future of Libya, they believe that the security situation will remain
tenuous throughout 2013. Magariaf also sees the national election scheduled for mid-2013 as a
potentially complicating factor. According to this source, Mangoush and Haftar focused on Bani
Walid under pressure from the Misrata commanders. These militia leaders were, according to a
knowledgeable source, angered over the death of one of their senior officials, Omran Shaban, at the
hands of pro-Qaddafi forces in Bani Walid. The Misrata commanders report that Shahan was one of
the organizers of the Misrata militia unit that captured and executed Qaddafi in 2011 outside of the
town of Sirte. The Misrata leaders, supported by the General National Council (GNC), demanded the
surrender of the men who arrested and killed Shahan. As the fighting expanded through late
September and early October, Magariaf and his advisors came to see Bani Walid as an important
symbol of their commitment to disarm the militias and anti-government groups, and increased their
involvement accordingly.)

L During mid-October 2012 Libyan President Yussef el Magariaf stated in private that
he and Prime Minister Ali Zidan have ordered National Libyan Army (NLA) Chief of Staff
General Youssef al Mangoush to establish a more coordinated operational relationship with
Misrata and Zintan militias in order to support expanded army operations throughout the country.
According to a sensitive source, prior to the death of the United States Ambassador on
September 11, 2012 Mangoush resisted greater reliance on these specific large militias, believing
that such a move undercuts the government's efforts to disarm and demobilize all of the militias
left over from the 2011 civil war. At this point, however, Mangoush agreed with Magariaf that
the situation in the country is becoming increasingly dangerous and unmanageable.
Accordingly, the Chief of Staff stated that he will work with Ousama al Jouvvali, the leader of the
Zintan forces to step up operations against the other militias, (supported by the Misrata troops),
that also come from the mountainous region of Western Libya. At the same time he will instruct
NLA troops under ground force commander General Khali& Belgasim Haftar to pursue
operations against tribal forces fighting on behalf of the Qaddafi family in Southern and
Southeastern Libya.

The Other Embassy Attack
Wall Street Journal Review & Outlook

Tehran tries to turn Yemen into another Lebanon.
Government emails from Libya released this week show Foggy Bottom's finest knew within hours that an Islamist terror
group was behind the September 11 attacks that killed four Americans. Maybe this truth drip will force President Obama
to explain why his Administration so strenuously downplayed a terrorist connection and insisted an anti-Islamic video
was to blame. But amid media and Congressional efforts to uncover the truth about Benghazi, it's worth paying
attention to another attack on a U.S. diplomatic mission last month.
On September 13, several hundred people, mostly young men, stormed the Embassy in Yemen's capital of Sanaa. The
American staff had been evacuated, but the compound was overrun. In the melee four Yemenis died. At the time the
event was lumped in with other anti-American protests in Tunisia, Pakistan and Egypt that week.
Yet it has since become clear that the Yemen assault was also well coordinated, likely by one or more militias. More
alarming is an Iranian connection that signals that Tehran is expanding its long and quiet war on America to a new front.
The U.S. isn't ruling out the possible complicity of a Yemeni army faction loyal to ousted President Ali Abdullah Saleh. He
stepped down from power in February as part of a U.S.-backed political transition. Since his departure, the military has
been divided amid jockeying for control in this tribal society. The Salehs deny the accusation.
During months of anti-government protests in 2011, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) also gained control of
territory in central Yemen. The group has several times tried to strike the U.S. mainland, and it may have been behind
the assassination this month of a Yemeni security officer employed at the U.S. Embassy.
However, the leading culprit is a Shiite rebel force backed by Tehran. Taking their name from a deceased commander,
the Houthi militia have since the mid-1990s fought against the Sunni-dominated government in Sanaa. According to
Western officials in Yemen, Iran has provided assistance for a Houthi resurgence in the past year Their fighters have
gone to Iran and Lebanon for training, and money and arms have flowed from both into Yemen, officials say. The
Houthis run a satellite TV channel, al-Maseera, from Beirut.
In July the Yemeni government said it had uncovered an Iranian spy ring in Sanaa. That got the attention of the Saudis,
who are anxious about Iranian efforts to stir up their co-religionist Shiites in Bahrain, Yemen and most of all in the
Kingdom itself.

Tehran's strategy in Yemen calls to mind Lebanon in the 1980s, when Iran built up Hezbollah into what has become the
leading political power in Lebanon. The Iran-backed terrorists burst onto the scene by bombing the U.S. embassy and
Marine barracks in Beirut. If the Houthis were in the lead last month, the command and control chain runs straight to
Tehran.
The interim Yemeni government is also grappling with a separatist armed uprising in the south. One of the leaders of the
fractured rebel force lives in Beirut and has tried to build a pro-Iran movement in the south, according to a Western
diplomat in Sanaa.
The Houthis and the southerners are separate groups with somewhat different agendas. But Iran may be facilitating a
partnership, as well as reaching out to al Qaeda. They have one goal in common: To bring down the pro-American
government in Sanaa. ""Despite the fact that they're on opposite ends of the religious spectrum, al Qaeda and Iran will
cooperate,"" a Western diplomat says. ""You see indications that Iran is helping al Qaeda by trying to forge relations
between AQAP, Houthis and southern rebels.""
The U.S. supports a ""national dialogue"" to stabilize Yemen, while waging a drone campaign against the AQAP. Both are
commendable goals. Yet Tehran has emerged as a new threat to Yemen's future and is fighting the U.S. through terror
proxies. Congress can seek more clarity about Iran's designs with an inquiry into the Sanaa attacks.

Illhave to defer to Gene on this. It's a fascinating read, and some stuff mentioned has already happened (such as the
appointment ofiuwaili as Minister of Defense Juwaili is close to the UAE, incidentally). But I simply do not know the
ins and outs of the new Libyan politics in sufficient detail to give a view as to the accuracy of this report A few bits
seemed off key (e.g, the reference that both the misrata and Zintan Brigades once reported ""loosely"" to BelHaj I don't
believe is true, since Juwaili and the IJAE supported the latter and Qatar the former).
The comment about Belhaj staying out of govt and thus retain the flexibility to carp and make trouble: Jake, you may
remember that AbZ warned exactly of that danger in that weird mtg Qatar insisted upon on the margins of UNGA.

By: Associated Press
November 21, 2012 07:03 PM EST
U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice said Wednesday her early account of the attack that killed the U.S. ambassador to Libya and
three other Americans in Benghazi was based on the initial intelligence community assessments and was always subject
to review and updates.
She said she respected Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who has been critical of her, but said ""some of the statements he's
made about me have been unfounded, but I look forward to having the opportunity at the appropriate time to discuss
all of this with him.""
Her comments attributed the attacks to a mob enraged over an anti-Muslim video posted on YouTube were widely
denounced by Republicans during the U.S. presidential campaign. The attack came an the 11th anniversary of the Sept.
11, 2001, terror attacks on the United States, and her critics said it was clearly a terrorist attack timed to take place on
the anniversary.
The focus has fallen on her because she is a longtime White House insider and is believed to be President Barack
Obama's first choice to replace Secrretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is not expected to stay on during his second term.
Rice told reporters outside the U.N. Security Council: ""As a senior U.S. diplomat, I agreed to a White House request to
appear on the Sunday shows to talk about the full range of national security issues of the day, which at that time were
primarily and particularly the protests that were enveloping and threatening many diplomatic facilities, American
diplomatic facilities around the world, and Iran's nuclear program.""
Hours before the Benghazi violence, a mob in Cairo attacked the U.S. Embassy there to denounce the videos as anti-
Islamic blasphemy. Killed in the Benghazi violence were Ambassador Chris Stevens, foreign service officer Sean Smith
and two former Navy SEALs, Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods.
Rice said, ""The attack on our facilities in Benghazi was obviously a significant piece of this"" pattern.
""When discussing he attack against our facilities in Benghazi, I relied solely and squarely on the information provided to
me by the intelligence community,"" she said.
""I made clear that the information was preliminary, and that our investigations would give us the definitive answers,""
she added.

Before the attack, Egypt, Turkey, Sudan, Italy, Tunisia, France and the UN had rep there
France and the UN pulled out after 9/11
But the question being posed has a false premise, i.e. that the US depended on foreign militia while the others
depended on their own resources
The US had tertiary dependence on the militia, as our primary and secondary reliance was on first the OS personnel arid
the second on the QRF
The others did not have an internal second

Diplomats still in Benghazi say they had long questioned U.S.
reliance on local militia
By Nancy A. Youssef
McClatchy Newspapers
On the day of the attack, U.S. officials had spotted a police officer taking photos of the compound from a villa
under construction across the streets. This was the view the officer would have had of the compound.
- Nancy A. Youssef /MCT
Even before the deadly Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. consulate that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and
three other Americans, diplomats from other nations and Libyan security officials had questioned the wisdom of
a U.S. decision to rely primarily on members of a local militia to protect its compound here.
Diplomats here told McClatchy that while it's customary to depend on local forces to protect diplomatic
missions, only the United States of the 10 or so foreign missions here allowed the local militia to be the first line
of defense. The others said they instead depended on military forces from their own country to provide security.
""A few months ago, there was a small attack here and the Libyans fled,"" said a diplomat from a European
nation who asked that he not be further identified so that he could speak candidly about his assessment of
security here. ""After that, I decided to only use special forces"" from his own country.
""We never considered using the brigades,"" he said, referring to the 17th of February Brigade, the local militia
that was considered the primary security force for the U.S. mission. ""We assumed the United States had a
special relationship with the brigades.""
Said another diplomat who requested anonymity for the same reasons: ""I would never depend on the brigades.""
The diplomat said he believed U.S. officials were unaware of the extremist links of those who were guarding
them. ""The mistake of the Americans was not following the trail of Islamic radicals,' he said.
For some, the cost of supplying security made operating in Benghazi prohibitive. The British, for example,
brought in their own troops and also hired Libyans to provide security, according to Khalid al Hadar, who owns
the compound that the British used as their offices here. But after a June attack on the British ambassador's
convoy, the British withdrew from Benghazi. A British official told McClatchy that the realization that security
would require a larger â€” and more expensive â€” British force in Benghazi helped fuel that decision.
Hadar said the British still check in periodically on their compound, where a shot-up bulletproof windshield
from the June ambush still sits in what was the consulate's carport.
Who was responsible for determining how the United States protected its consulate here remains unclear two
months after Stevens' death. According to the State Department, the ambassador, in consultation with deputies

and security advisers, makes all security decisions, though they can be overruled from Washington. At a hearing
of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee last month, Eric Allan Nordstrom, who served as
the chief security officer at the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli from September 2011 until July, testified that he had
requested additional security.
Charlene Lamb, the deputy assistant secretary for diplomatic security, defended the security procedures that had
been taken in Benghazi, telling the hearing that there were five American security guards â€” the number
recommended by Nordstrom â€” along with Libyans in Benghazi when the attack took place.
""We had the correct number of assets in Benghazi at the time of 9/11 ,"" she said.
It is unknown what Stevens' own position on security in Benghazi was. A Western diplomat here said the trip
was Stevens' first extensive visit to Benghazi since he'd assumed the ambassador's post in May. The diplomat
said that when he heard the attack begin about 9:30 p.m., he assumed ""that Chris was long gone.""
The diplomat expressed surprise that Stevens hadn't been evacuated at the first sign of trouble. ""We used to
take training from the Americans"" on diplomatic security, he said.
How the U.S. vetted its local security force in Benghazi may be among the questions to come up Thursday
when the Senate Intelligence Committee holds a closed hearing on the attack. Witnesses expected to appear
include Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and Matt Olsen, director of the National
Counterterrorism Center. David Petraeus, who resigned Friday as director of the CIA after acknowledging an
extramarital affair, had been scheduled to appear but will be replaced by Acting CIA Director Michael Morrell,
according to Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., the committee's chairwoman.
On Wednesday, during a ceremony honoring Stevens, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that the
administration has, in the wake of the 9/11 attack, dispatched a joint State and Defense Department task force
""to review high-threat posts to determine whether there are other improvements we need in light of the evolving
security challenges we now face.""
Diplomats here, however, say they believe one such improvement had become obvious in the months after a
NATO air campaign helped topple the government of longtime Libyan leader Moanunar Gadhafi: Don't expect
local forces to protect you when they can't even protect themselves against local extremists and terrorists
groups in a city now defined by reprisal attacks. In the past week alone, two police stations here were bombed
and a police colonel's patrol car was destroyed in front of his house; extremist groups seeking to wrest control
of the city are the suspected culprits.
According to two guards who were at the compound that night, a four-member team from the 17th of February
Brigade's VIP protection unit was assigned to provide security inside the compound and serve as a quick-
reaction force. The 17th of February guards lived in a house closest to the front gate. According to the guards,
they tried to fend off the attack of as many 100 men that night, shooting repeatedly at them.
But 17th of February brigade leaders say they never considered themselves responsible for consulate security,
and Najib Muftah, 25, a co-founder of the brigade's VIP unit, denied that his group was in charge. ""How could
four people secure a consulate?"" he said.
Consulate security that night was a hodge-podge of local groups, in addition to a handful of Americans,
including Stevens' bodyguard. Outside, members of Libya's newly formed police force stood guard, sitting in
their parked vehicles. In addition, as many as five unarmed Libyans who worked for the Blue Mountain Group,
a Wales-based contractor, were stationed around the perimeter to watch for suspicious activity and search
visitors to the compound.
But as a rowdy caravan of attackers came barreling down the road leading to the consulate, the police officers
parked on the other side of the street from the consulate fled, according to a 31-year-old private security guard
who was there that night. The security guard asked not to be named for fearing he would be targeted for
working with Americans.

Earlier in the day, somewhere between 4 a.m. and 6 a.m., a member of the Blue Mountain Group reported that
he had seen one of the police officers photographing the inside of the compound from the upper floor of a villa
under construction across the street, according to the security guard, whose story confirms previous accounts.
But while reporters going through the consulate location in recent days discovered memos that suggested the
consulate had complained to Libyan authorities about the incident, Interior Ministry officials in Benghazi said
they were never contacted by U.S. officials.
Salah Daghman, the newly named deputy minister of interior for Benghazi, said that in any case it would be
unlikely that members of his police force would have challenged the Islamist group suspected of leading the
Sept. 11 attack. He described his men as ""afraid of Ansar al Shariah.""
""Everyone has a gun, he said. ""Benghazi is not secure.""
Members of the 17th of February Brigade first formed a ""VIP protection"" unit shortly after the anti-Gadhafi
uprising began in Febraury 2011. A group of about 50, they were trained by Qataris to protect the cavalcade of
politicians and diplomats who came to Benghazi, which was then the capital of rebel-controlled eastern Libya.
""If anything happened to the envoys that came to support the Libyan people, people would have believed
Gadhafi claims that we are all al Qaida,"" Muftah said. Among the foreign visitors the brigade's VIP unit
protected was French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who made a stunning visit here after Gadhafi's government
collapsed.
Stevens, who had been a special representative to the rebel government during the civil war, used the protection
unit as well, but not so much for security but as guides in the city, Muftah said. After the war, the brigade
continued to provide escorts as the U.S. formalized its presence here; most likely, Muftah said, because it was
the strongest force in Benghazi.
In addition, the brigade had a base less than a mile from the consulate that could provide additional forces if
needed, as it did Sept. 11. ""And we had good relations with the United States,"" Muftah said.
Once the rebel government moved to Tripoli and nations began to reopen embassies there, the United States
kept working with the brigade, as many of its troops were incorporated into the newly formed Libyan army.
Once Benghazi had a trained and running police force, the Americans asked for police forces to be stationed
outside the consulate, said Fawzi Waniss, the head of the Benghazi Supreme Security Committee, the group
with responsibility for melding Libya's many armed organizations into a unified force.
As the security situation deteriorated, several Libyan officials and the Blue Mountain guards said they urged the
United States to buttress security at the consulate, even as Stevens was wildly popular among residents here.
The Libyans, they said, could not secure themselves from a mounting extremist threat.
""I told them, you should have your own security,"" Waniss said. ""Don't depend on the Libyans.""
But others have suggested that the U.S. officials may have felt such a step was unnecessary because the CIA
had established offices about a mile away and had promised to send security officers to the consulate, if needed.
All of the diplomats interviewed for this story said they were unaware of the CIA station's existence.
That in fact happened on the night of Sept. 11, according to a CIA timeline, which said security officers from
the CIA station, which U.S. officials refer to as an annex, were dispatched 25 minutes after the first reports of
trouble. It took another 25 minutes for the force to reach the consulate, however, because of resistance from
militants.
One diplomat here said that while he appreciated the effort of the CIA guards to render assistance, 25 minutes in
such a situation ""is too late.""

Statement on the Attack in Benghazi
September 11, 2012
I condemn in the strongest terms the attack on our mission in Benghazi today. As we work to
secure our personnel and facilities, we have confirmed that one of our State Department officers
was killed. We are heartbroken by this terrible loss. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family
and those who have suffered in this attack.
This evening, I called Libyan President Magariaf to coordinate additional support to protect
Americans in Libya. President Magariaf expressed his condemnation and condolences and
pledged his government's full cooperation.
Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted
on the Internet. The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs
of others. Our commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation.
But let me be clear: There is never any justification for violent acts of this kind.
In light of the events of today, the United States government is working with partner countries
around the world to protect our personnel, our missions, and American citizens worldwide.
Statement on the Death of American Personnel in Benghazi, Libya
September 12, 2012
It is with profound sadness that I share the news of the death of four American personnel in
Benghazi, Libya yesterday. Among them were United States Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens
and Foreign Service Information Management Officer, Sean Smith. We are still making next of
kin notifications for the other two individuals. Our hearts go out to all their families and
colleagues.
A 21 year veteran of the Foreign Service, Ambassador Stevens died last night from injuries he
sustained in the attack on our office in Benghazi.
I had the privilege of swearing in Chris for his post in Libya only a few months ago. He spoke
eloquently about his passion for service, for diplomacy and for the Libyan people. This
assignment was only the latest in his more than two decades of dedication to advancing closer
ties with the people of the Middle East and North Africa which began as a Peace Corps
Volunteer in Morocco. As the conflict in Libya unfolded, Chris was one of the first Americans
on the ground in Benghazi. He risked his own life to lend the Libyan people a helping hand to
build the foundation for a new, free nation. He spent every day since helping to finish the work
that he started. Chris was committed to advancing America's values and interests, even when
that meant putting himself in danger.
Sean Smith was a husband and a father of two, who joined the Department ten years ago. Like

Chris, Sean was one of our best. Prior to arriving in Benghazi, he served in Baghdad, Pretoria,
Montreal, and most recently The Hague.
All the Americans we lost in yesterday's attacks made the ultimate sacrifice. We condemn this
vicious and violent attack that took their lives, which they had committed to helping the Libyan
people reach for a better future.
America's diplomats and development experts stand on the front lines every day for our country.
We are honored by the service of each and every one of them.
Remarks on the Deaths of American Personnel in Benghazi, Libya
September 12, 2012
Yesterday, our U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya was attacked. Heavily armed militants
assaulted the compound and set fire to our buildings. American and Libyan security personnel
battled the attackers together. Four Americans were killed. They included Sean Smith, a Foreign
Service information management officer, and our Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens. We are
still making next of kin notifications for the other two individuals.
This is an attack that should shock the conscience of people of all faiths around the world. We
condemn in the strongest terms this senseless act of violence, and we send our prayers to the
families, friends, and colleagues of those we've lost.
All over the world, every day, America's diplomats and development experts risk their lives in
the service of our country and our values, because they believe that the United States must be a
force for peace and progress in the world, that these aspirations are worth striving and sacrificing
for. Alongside our men and women in uniform, they represent the best traditions of a bold and
generous nation.
In the lobby of this building, the State Department, the names of those who have fallen in the line
of duty are inscribed in marble. Our hearts break over each one. And now, because of this
tragedy, we have new heroes to honor and more friends to mourn.
Chris Stevens fell in love with the Middle East as a young Peace Corps volunteer teaching
English in Morocco. He joined the Foreign Service, learned languages, won friends for America
in distant places, and made other people's hopes his own.
In the early days of the Libyan revolution, I asked Chris to be our envoy to the rebel opposition.
He arrived on a cargo ship in the port of Benghazi and began building our relationships with
Libya's revolutionaries. He risked his life to stop a tyrant, then gave his life trying to help build a
better Libya. The world needs more Chris Stevenses. I spoke with his sister, Ann, this morning,
and told her that he will be remembered as a hero by many nations.

Sean Smith was an Air Force veteran. He spent 10 years as an information management officer
in the State Department, he was posted at The Hague, and was in Libya on a brief temporary
assignment. He was a husband to his wife Heather, with whom I spoke this morning. He was a
father to two young children, Samantha and Nathan. They will grow up being proud of the
service their father gave to our country, service that took him from Pretoria to Baghdad, and
finally to Benghazi.
The mission that drew Chris and Sean and their colleagues to Libya is both noble and necessary,
and we and the people of Libya honor their memory by carrying it forward. This is not easy.
Today, many Americans are asking â€” indeed, I asked myselfâ€” how could this happen? How
could this happen in a country we helped liberate, in a city we helped save from destruction?
This question reflects just how complicated and, at times, how confounding the world can be.
But we must be clear-eyed, even in our grief. This was an attack by a small and savage group â€”
not the people or Government of Libya. Everywhere Chris and his team went in Libya, in a
country scarred by war and tyranny, they were hailed as friends and partners. And when the
attack came yesterday, Libyans stood and fought to defend our post. Some were wounded.
Libyans carried Chris' body to the hospital, and they helped rescue and lead other Americans to
safety. And last night, when I spoke with the President of Libya, he strongly condemned the
violence and pledged every effort to protect our people and pursue those responsible.
The friendship between our countries, borne out of shared struggle, will not be another casualty
of this attack. A free and stable Libya is still in America's interest and security, and we will not
turn our back on that, nor will we rest until those responsible for these attacks are found and
brought to justice. We are working closely with the Libyan authorities to move swiftly and
surely. We are also working with partners around the world to safeguard other American
embassies, consulates, and citizens.
There will be more time later to reflect, but today, we have work to do. There is no higher
priority than protecting our men and women wherever they serve. We are working to determine
the precise motivations and methods of those who carried out this assault. Some have sought to
justify this vicious behavior, along with the protest that took place at our Embassy in Cairo
yesterday, as a response to inflammatory material posted on the intemet. America's commitment
to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation. But let me be clear â€” there is
no justification for this, none. Violence like this is no way to honor religion or faith. And as long
as there are those who would take innocent life in the name of God, the world will never know a
true and lasting peace.
It is especially difficult that this happened on September I I th. It's an anniversary that means a
great deal to all Americans. Every year on that day, we are reminded that our work is not yet
finished, that the job of putting an end to violent extremism and building a safe and stable world
continues. But September 11th means even more than that. It is a day on which we remember

Statement on the Deaths of Tyrone S. Woods and Glen A. Doherty in Benghazi, Libya
September 13, 2012
The attack on our diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya on Tuesday claimed the lives of four
Americans. Yesterday, I spoke about two: Ambassador Chris Stevens and Information
Management Officer Sean Smith. Today, we also recognize the two security personnel who died
helping protect their colleagues. Tyrone S. Woods and Glen A. Doherty were both decorated
military veterans who served our country with honor and distinction. Our thoughts, prayers, and
deepest gratitude are with their families and friends. Our embassies could not carry on our
critical work around the world without the service and sacrifice of brave people like Tyrone and
Glen.
Tyrone's friends and colleagues called him ""Rone,"" and they relied on his courage and skill,
honed over two decades as a Navy SEAL. In uniform, he served multiple tours in Iraq and
Afghanistan. Since 2010, he protected American diplomatic personnel in dangerous posts from
Central America to the Middle East. He had the hands of a healer as well as the arm of a warrior,
earning distinction as a registered nurse and certified paramedic. All our hearts go out to
Tyrone's wife Dorothy and his three sons, Tyrone Jr., Hunter, and Kai, who was born just a few
months ago.
We also grieve for Glen Doherty, called Bub, and his family: his father Bernard, his mother
Barbara, his brother Gregory, and his sister Kathleen. Glen was also a former Navy SEAL and an
experienced paramedic. And he put his life on the line many times, protecting Americans in Iraq,
Afghanistan, and other hotspots. In the end, he died the way he lived â€” with selfless honor and
unstinting valor.
We condemn the attack that took the lives of these heroes in the strongest terms, and we are
taking additional steps to safeguard American embassies, consulates, and citizens around the
world. This violence should shock the conscience of people of all faiths and traditions. We
appreciate the statements of support that have poured in from across the region and beyond.

violence, hate, and division.

our country and our values. They help make the United States the greatest force for peace,

Remarks at the Opening Plenary of the U.S.-Morocco Strategic Dialogue
September 13, 2012
SECRETARY CLINTON: Good morning. Well, let me welcome our friends and colleagues
from Morocco here to the Benjamin Franklin Room on the eighth floor of the State Department
for this very important first session of the U.S.-Morocco Strategic Dialogue. Before I begin to
address the significance of this Strategic Dialogue and the next step in our long relations with
Morocco, I want to say a few words about the events unfolding in the world today.
We are closely watching what is happening in Yemen and elsewhere, and we certainly hope and
expect that there will be steps taken to avoid violence and prevent the escalation of protests into
violence.
I also want to take a moment to address the video circulating on the Internet that has led to these
protests in a number of countries. Let me state very clearly â€” and I hope it is obvious â€” that the
United States Government had absolutely nothing to do with this video. We absolutely reject its
content and message. America's commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very
beginning of our nation. And as you know, we are home to people of all religions, many of
whom came to this country seeking the right to exercise their own religion, including, of course,
millions of Muslims. And we have the greatest respect for people of faith.
To us, to me personally, this video is disgusting and reprehensible. It appears to have a deeply
cynical purpose: to denigrate a great religion and to provoke rage. But as I said yesterday, there
is no justification, none at all, for responding to this video with violence, We condemn the
violence that has resulted in the strongest terms, and we greatly appreciate that many Muslims in
the United States and around the world have spoken out on this issue.
Violence, we believe, has no place in religion and is no way to honor religion. Islam, like other
religions, respects the fundamental dignity of human beings, and it is a violation of that
fundamental dignity to wage attacks on innocents. As long as there are those who are willing to
shed blood and take innocent life in the name of religion, the name of God, the world will never
know a true and lasting peace. It is especially wrong for violence to be directed against
diplomatic missions. These are places whose very purpose is peaceful: to promote better
understuiding across countries and cultures. All governments have a responsibility to protect

those spaces and people, because to attack an embassy is to attack the idea that we can work
together to build understanding and a better future.
Now, I know it is hard for some people to understand why the United States cannot or does not
just prevent these kinds of reprehensible videos from ever seeing the light of day. Now, I would
note that in today's world with today's technologies, that is impossible. But even if it were
possible, our country does have a long tradition of free expression which is enshrined in our
Constitution and our law, and we do not stop individual citizens from expressing their views no
matter how distasteful they may be.
There are, of course, different views around the world about the outer limits of free speech and
free expression, but there should be no debate about the simple proposition that violence in
response to speech is not acceptable. We all â€” whether we are leaders in government, leaders in
civil society or religious leaders â€” must draw the line at violence. And any responsible leader
should be standing up now and drawing that line.
I wanted to begin with this statement, because, as our Moroccan friends and all of you know, this
has been a difficult week at the State Department. I very much appreciate, Minister, the
condolences your government expressed to our Embassy in Rabat And even though that tragedy
happened far away in Benghazi, we found a reminder of the deep bounds that connect Morocco
to the United States. It was in the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco that one of the Americans
we lost this week, Ambassador Chris Stevens, fell in love with the region when he served as a
Peace Corps volunteer there. That experience set him on a decades-long career of service. So in
the memory of fallen friends and colleagues, let us remind ourselves of the many ways in which
riot just our governments but the people of our two nations have worked together to build a better
future.
In many ways, the United States looks to Morocco to be a leader and a model. His Majesty King
Mohammed deserves great credit for the work you've undertaken. In fact, after my visit to Rabat
earlier this year. I told my team: ""We need to start a Strategic Dialogue with Morocco."" No
country has been a friend of the United States longer than Morocco. You were the first nation to
recognize us back in 1777. But we're not satisfied with simply having a friendship that is
longstanding We want one that is dynamic, growing, looking toward the future. So let me
highlight a few of the areas we should focus on today.
On political reform, we have all seen remarkable changes taking place across North Africa and
the Middle East. I commend Morocco and your government for your efforts to stay ahead of
these changes by holding free and fair elections, empowering the elected parliament, taking other
steps to ensure that the government reflects the will of the people. Today, our political working
group will discuss how the United States can continue to support your efforts to translate
commitments into actions. Because as we all know, democracy, real reform, require that people
themselves feel the changes in their evetyday lives: the courts reformed, the government more

open and transparent, universal human rights of all Moroccans â€” men and women alike â€”
respected.
I'm especially pleased by Morocco's commitments to take on the deeply troubling problem of
child marriage. We know that child brides are less likely to get an education, more likely to face
life-threatening problems, particularly around child birth and delivery, which not only
shortchanges them but can even rob them and their communities of their lives and talents. So we
want to encourage the government and civil society to continue their important work together on
this issue.
With regard to the Western Sahara, the United States continues to support efforts to find a
peaceful, sustainable, mutually agreed-upon solution. U.S. policy toward the Western Sahara has
remained consistent for many years. We have made clear that Morocco's autonomy plan is
serious, realistic, and credible, and that it represents a potential approach that could satisfy the
aspirations of the people in the Western Sahara to run their own affairs in peace and dignity. We
continue to support the negotiations carried out by the United Nations and hope parties can work
toward resolution.
With respect to the economy, our second working group will focus on what more can be done to
deliver tangible economic benefits. Morocco's economy is relatively healthy, but you face the
same problem that is now endemic across the world â€” unemployment is still too high, especially
among young people.
That's why the United States is providing $1.5 million to support an effort to attract foreign
investors, foster local economic development, and combat corruption across the region. And I'm
pleased to announce that later this year we will hold a Morocco business development
conference here in Washington to connect businesses from both countries.
Today, we should discuss ways to build on all of these efforts by increasing bilateral trade, a
particular goal of mine since so much trade from Morocco goes to Europe. I'd like to increase
the amount of trade coming to the United States, and also to improve economic integration
across North Africa, which could greatly benefit Morocco because of Morocco's stability and
Morocco's very strong economic foundation. The greater integration there is, the greater the
benefits for Moroccans.
Third, the attack in Benghazi this week reminds us that security remains a vital issue. Through
our work together on the Global Counterterrorism Task Force, the United States and Morocco
already share crucial information and best practices, and I thank Morocco for hosting a Global
Counterterrorism Task Force workshop on threats in the South Atlantic next month.

We are also collaborating through USAID, the Peace Corps, and other agencies to help provide
Moroccan youth with alternatives to criminal and extremist organizations. And so we are
partnering to help strengthen Morocco's criminal justice system and law enforcement.
There will be a lot to discuss in the meeting today. And let me add, the United States greatly
appreciates the constructive role Morocco is playing on the UN Security Council, especially your
support for the effort to end the violence and bloodshed in Syria and help to usher in a new
democratic future for that country. I commend Morocco for offering to host the next ministerial
meeting of the Friends of the Syrian People, and we look forward to continuing to work closely
together as close partners even after your term on the Security Council has ended.
Finally, our education and cultural ties are reason for much celebration. This year marks the 30th
anniversary of our official program to facilitate academic exchanges and other bonds between us.
There are more than 5,000 Moroccan alumni of these programs. Two are with us today â€” Dr.
Benjelloun and Dr. Ouaouicha â€” and we thank them. But among all our work on this front, from
preserving Morocco's historic sites to empowering youth, there's one area I particularly hope we
can focus on today and receive your advice and counsel â€” namely, interfaith dialogue.
In these tense and turbulent times, it's more important than ever for people of different faiths to
exchange ideas, to build understanding, to promote religious tolerance. It's one of the great
challenges of the 21st century, and it's one that we must address together.
So we have a lot of work to do, Minister, but our friendship runs long and deep, and as the treaty
our nations signed in 1786 says, and I quote, ""Trusting in God, it will remain permanent."" I'm
confident that we will continue to solve problems and produce results that make our nations
stronger, more peaceful, more secure, more prosperous, and also contribute to doing the same for
the world.
So again, let me welcome you, Minister. It's been a great pleasure for me to get to know you, to
work with you, to be your colleague bilaterally, regionally, and globally, and also welcome your
distinguished delegation.
Thank you. (Applause.)
Remarks at Reception Ntlarking Eid ul-Fitr
September 13, 2012
SECRETARY CLINTON: Good evening, and although I am many weeks overdue in saying it:
Eid Mubarak. No matter how belated we are honoring Eid and the end of Ramadan, this is a
cherished tradition here at the State Department. And I would like to thank all of you for being
here, including the many members of the Diplomatic Corps.

Tonight, our gathering is more somber than any of us would like. This comes during sad and
difficult days for the State Department family. We lost four Americans. They were good and
brave men. They were committed to the cause of building a brighter future for the people of
Libya. And we condemn the violence in the strongest terms, the violence against our posts in
Benghazi, in Egypt, and now in Yemen.
The Libyan ambassador is with us tonight, and I want to take a moment to thank him for the
support that his government and the Libyan people have shown to the United States in this
tragedy, particularly the outpouring of feelings of grief and loss because of the killing of our
ambassador.
Ambassador Aujali, would you mind saying a few words?
AMBASSADOR AMU: [redacted]
SECRETARY CLINTON: Thank you very much, Ambassador. I know that that was a very
personal loss for you, as it was for me. I'm the one who sent Chris to Benghazi during the
revolution to show support and be able to advise our government about what we could do to
bring freedom and democracy and opportunity to the people of Libya.
Religious freedom and religious tolerance are essential to the stability of any nation, any people.
Hatred and violence in the name of religion only poison the well. All people of faith and good
will know that the actions of a small and savage group in Benghazi do not honor religion or God
in any way. Nor do they speak for the more than one billion Muslims around the world, many of
whom have shown an outpouring of support during this time
Unfortunately, however, over the last 24 hours, we have also seen violence spread elsewhere.
Some seek to justify this behavior as a response to inflammatory, despicable material posted on
the intemet. As I said earlier today, the United States rejects both the content and the message of
that video. The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of
others. At our meeting earlier today, my colleague, the foreign minister of Morocco, said that all
prophets should be respected because they are all symbols of our humanity, for all humanity.
But both of us were crystal clear in this paramount message: There is never any justification for
violent acts of this kind. And we look to leaders around the world to stand up and speak out
against violence, and to take steps to protect diplomatic missions from attack.
Think about it. When Christians are subject to insults to their faith, and that certainly happens,
we expect them not to resort to violence. When Hindus or Buddhists are subjected to insults to
their faiths, and that also certainly happens, we expect them not to resort to violence. The same
goes for all faiths, including Islam.

When all of us who are people of faith - and I am one â€” feel the pain of insults, of
misunderstanding, of denigration to what we cherish, we must expect ourselves and others not to
resort to violence, That is a universal standard and expectation, and it is everyone's obligation to
meet that, so that we make no differences, we expect no less of ourselves than we expect of
others, You cannot respond to offensive speech with violence without begetting more violence.
And I so strongly believe that the great religions of the world are stronger than any insults. They
have withstood offense for centuries. Refraining from violence, then, is not a sign of weakness in
one's faith; it is absolutely the opposite, a sign that one's faith is unshakable.
So tonight, we must come together and recommit ourselves to working toward a future marked
by understanding and acceptance rather than distrust, hatred, and fear. We can pledge that
whenever one person speaks out in ignorance and bigotry, ten voices will answer. They will
answer resoundingly against the offense and the insult, answering ignorance with enlightenment,
answering hatred with understanding, answering darkness with light; that if one person commits
a violent act in the name of religion, millions will stand up and condemn it out of strength.
In times like these, it can be easy to despair that some differences are irreconcilable, some
mountains too steep to climb; we will therefore never reach the level of understanding and
peacefulness that we seek, and which I believe the great religions of the world call us to pursue.
But that's not what I believe, and I don't think it's what you believe either here tonight. Part of
what makes our country so special is we keep trying. We keep working. We keep investing in
our future. We keep supporting the next generation, believing that young people can keep us
moving forward in a positive direction.
So tonight I think it's important that we talk not just about that better tomorrow that we all seek,
but also about some of the things â€” the real, practical, tangible things â€” that young people are
doing to help shape that better future.
Two years ago in this room, at our Eid reception, we launched a program called Generation
Change to lead a grassroots agenda of positive engagement with Muslim communities. And I
asked the young Muslim leaders in the audience that night to be our unofficial ambassadors, to
help build personal connections, seek out partners in other countries. And I can report to you
tonight they did not disappoint. In a few minutes, you're going to meet some of these young
leaders, each with a powerful story to tell.
The Generation Change network that started in this room now circles the globe. We are building
an international alliance of young people who want to drive change in their own communities.
They act as mentors, spark respectful debates, simply offer words of encouragement when
needed. But most importantly, they inspire others to keep expanding the circle of mutual
understanding and respect, one person at a time.

Even as we work to spread tolerance more broadly, we also are working to deepen our
appreciation for the experiences of others. Our 2012 Hours Against Hate initiative encourages
young people to put themselves in another person's shoes through service projects. So far, young
people from all over the world have pledged thousands of volunteer hours to help people from a
different background, to see them as a fellow human being, not a stereotype, not a caricature, but
another real live person â€” people who don't look like you, live like you, pray like you, but with
whom we will share this planet. And therefore, we have work to do.
People of faith and conscience are called to be the leaders of tolerance. In my tradition, like all
traditions, we are expected to love one another. And together, we have to translate that into better
understanding and cooperation. I'm particularly pleased that the young people you will hear from
tonight are really setting an example, not only for young people elsewhere in the world but,
frankly, for us who are older as well.
Let me now call to the stage someone who has been a tremendous assistance to me in these
efforts. Farah Pandith is the Department's first Special Representative to Muslim Communities.
And from the beginning, she has made reaching out to young people and civil society her top
priority. Farah will introduce you to three young leaders who I am very proud of
Remarks at the Transfer of Remains Ceremony to Honor Those Lost in Attacks in Benghazi, Libya
September 14, 2012
SECRETARY CLINTON: Thank you very much, Chaplain. Mr. President, Mr. Vice President,
Secretary Panetta, Ambassador Rice, Secretary Powell and Mrs. Powell, family members of the
four patriots and heroes we bring home, members of the State Department family, ladies and
gentlemen, today we bring home four Americans who gave their lives for our country and our
values. To the families of our fallen colleagues, I offer our most heartfelt condolences and
deepest gratitude.
Sean Smith joined the State Department after six years in the Air Force. He was respected as an
expert on technology by colleagues in Pretoria, Baghdad, Montreal, and The Hague. He enrolled
in correspondence courses at Penn State and had high hopes for the future. Sean leaves behind a
loving wife Heather, two young children, Samantha and Nathan, and scores of grieving family,
friends, and colleagues. And that's just in this world. Because online in the virtual worlds that
Sean helped create, he is also being mourned by countless competitors, collaborators, and garners
who shared his passion.
Tyrone Woods, known to most as Rone, spent two decades as a Navy SEAL, serving multiple
tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. Since 2010, he protected American diplomatic personnel in
dangerous posts from Central America to the Middle East. He had the hands of a healer as well
as the arms of a warrior, earning distinction as a registered nurse and certified paramedic. Our
hearts go out to Tyrone's wife Dorothy, and his three sons Tyrone, Jr., Hunter, and Kai, born just
a few months ago, along with his grieving faii)ily, friends, and colleagues.

Glen Doherty, who went by Bub, was also a former SEAL and an experienced paramedic. He too
died as he lived, serving his country and protecting his colleagues. Glen deployed to some of the
most dangerous places on Earth, including Iraq and Afghanistan, always putting his life on the
line to safeguard other Americans. Our thoughts and prayers are with Glen's father Bernard, his
mother Barbara, his brother Gregory, his sister Kathleen, and their grieving families, friends, and
colleagues.
I was honored to know Ambassador Chris Stevens. I want to thank his parents and siblings, who
are here today, for sharing Chris with us and with our country. What a wonderful gift you gave
us. Over his distinguished career in the Foreign Service, Chris won friends for the United States
in far-flung places. He made those people's hopes his own. During the revolution in Libya, he
risked his life to help protect the Libyan people from a tyrant, and he gave his life helping them
build a better country.
People loved to work with Chris. And as he rose through the ranks, they loved to work for Chris.
He was known not only for his courage but for his smile â€” goofy but contagious â€” for his sense
of fun and that California cool.
In the days since the attack, so many Libyans â€” including the Ambassador from Libya to the
United States, who is with us today â€” have expressed their sorrow and solidarity. One young
woman, her head covered and her eyes haunted with sadness, held up a handwritten sign that said
""Thugs and killers don't represent Benghazi nor Islam,"" The President of the Palestinian
Authority, who worked closely with Chris when he served in Jerusalem, sent me a letter
remembering his energy and integrity, and deploring â€” and I quote â€” ""an act of ugly terror.""
Many others from across the Middle East and North Africa have offered similar sentiments.
This has been a difficult week for the State Department and for our country. We've seen the
heavy assault on our post in Benghazi that took the lives of those brave men. We've seen rage
and violence directed at American embassies over an awful interne video that we had nothing to
do with. It is hard for the American people to make sense of that because it is senseless, and it is
totally unacceptable.
The people of Egypt, Libya, Yemen, and Tunisia did not trade the tyranny of a dictator for the
tyranny of a mob. Reasonable people and responsible leaders in these countries need to do
everything they can to restore security and hold accountable those behind these violent acts. And
we will, under the President's leadership, keep taking steps to protect our personnel around the
world.
There will be more difficult days ahead, but it is important that we don't lose sight of the
fundamental fact that America must keep leading the world. We owe it to those four men to
continue the long, hard work of diplomacy. I am enormously proud of the men and women of the
State Department. I'm proud of all those across our government, civilian and military alike, who

represent America abroad. They help make the United States the greatest force for peace,
progress, and human dignity the world has ever known. If the last few days teach us anything, let
it be this: That this work and the men and women who risk their lives to do it are at the heart of
what makes America great and good.
So we will wipe away our tears, stiffen our spines, and face the future undaunted. And we will
do it together, protecting and helping one another, just like Sean, Tyrone, Glen, and Chris always
did. May God bless them and grant their families peace and solace, and may God continue to
bless the United States of America.
And now, let me have the great honor of introducing someone who came to the State Department
earlier this week to grieve with us. He well understands and values the work that these men were
doing for our country. The President of the United States.
Remarks With Mexican Secretary of Foreign Relations Patricia Espinosa After Their
Meeting
September 18, 2012
SECRETARY CLINTON: Good afternoon, everyone. And it is such a pleasure for me to
welcome my friend and colleague, Secretary Espinosa, along with a very distinguished
delegation of officials from the Mexican Government for this continuation of consultation at the
highest levels of each of our governments.
Before I turn to the matters discussed today, let me give a brief update on the ongoing U.S.
response to the protests in the Middle East and elsewhere. I'm sure as you know already, we are
taking aggressive steps to protect our staffs in embassies and consulates worldwide. That
includes reviewing our security posture at every post and augmenting it where necessary. And
we are working closely with the Libyan Government in our efforts to bring to justice those who
murdered our four American colleagues in Benghazi.
The FBI is now in Tripoli to join the investigation with Libyan officials, and there is nothing
more important to us than ensuring the safety of our American representatives worldwide. At the
same time, as I have said to State Department employees, the incidents of the past week highlight
how important our work is. The United States must and will remain strongly engaged in the
world. Our men and women risk their lives in service to our country and our values, because they
know that the United States must be a force for peace and progress. That is worth striving and
sacrificing for, and nothing that happened last week changes this fundamental fact.
Now, turning to our friends and partners in Mexico, we are always pleased to have a chance to
discuss matters of mutual interest and concern between us. Mexico is one of our closest friends
as well as partner on dozens of critical issues. So we talk about every kind of issue you can
imagine, from education and healthcare to poverty alleviation to the environment. But today, we
focused on a top priority for us both a security.

We just co-chaired the fourth meeting of the U.S.-Mexico Merida High-Level Consultative
Group. This is the last one we will hold during the Calderon Administration. And I want to offer
my personal appreciation to President Calderon and to Foreign Secretary Espinosa for their
leadership and commitment to this partnership and to all on both sides of the border in our
governments who have been deeply engaged and committed to it. The Merida Initiative
represents an unprecedented level of security cooperation between Mexico and the United States.
As our countries continue to deal with the serious challenge of transnational criminal
organizations, including drug traffickers, illegal arms traffickers, money launderers, and violent
gangs that threaten people on both sides of the border, we well know there is no quick and easy
way to stop these criminals and bring them to justice. But nevertheless, during the past now
nearly four years, our countries have collaborated to an extraordinary and unprecedented degree.
We have brought together policy makers and experts from across our governments and societies
who have worked hand in hand to keep our people safe. And I think the habits of cooperation we
have built are among our most important achievements, and we will rely on them for a long time
to come.
Today, our delegations reviewed the gains we've made on key priorities, including improving
law enforcement coordination, reducing the demand for drugs, modernizing our border
infrastructure, strengthening the rule of law, and building more resilient and empowered
communities. We also discussed the lessons we've learned and the work that lies ahead in these
and other areas, which our joint statement will reflect. I want to underscore how important our
security relationship with Mexico is to the United States.
The Government of Mexico and the Mexican people have faced the threat posed by these
criminals with courage and resolve, and we remain committed to doing everything we can to
support Mexico as it continues to work to bring those criminals to justice. This is a transnational
problem, and it calls for a transnational solution, and the United States believes this is a matter of
shared responsibility. That was the first message I brought as Secretary of State when I came to
Mexico, and it continues to be the hallmark of our efforts together. Making sure our people are
safe and our neighbors are safe is of the utmost importance to us.
Now, our two countries share many other priorities, and one of them, empowering women and
girls, was also addressed today. We took the opportunity, the Foreign Secretary and I, to sign a
Memorandum of Understanding between our countries to work together to advance gender
equality, empower girls and women, promote their human rights, and enhance their security.
So again, Secretary Espinosa, let me thank you for years of work and effort, for our productive
conversations in many places around the world and again today, and for being such a valuable
colleague and partner. The United States deeply, deeply values our relationship with Mexico and
the ties of family and friendship that connect so many millions of our people.

And we look forward to the future. We believe strongly that presidential administrations may
change, elections will come and go, but we have established a firm foundation for cooperation
that has already benefited both our countries and which will continue to benefit both of our
countries for many years ahead. So thank you very much.
MS. NULAND: We'll take (inaudible). Margaret Brennan, CBS News.
QUESTION: Madam Secretary, thanks for your time. Are you any closer to finding who killed
Ambassador Chris Stevens?, Libya's President says this attack was planned for months. Are you
confident he's wrong and that security measures were appropriate? And will you leave justice to
the Libyans?
SECRETARY CLINTON: As I said at the outset, we are taking aggressive steps to protect our
people and our consulates and embassies around the world. We are reviewing our security
posture at every post and working with host governments to be sure they know what our security-
needs are wherever necessary. We are also working closely with the Libyan Government to bring
the perpetrators to justice so that we can be assured that we have found who murdered our four,
colleagues and under what circumstances. As I said, the FBI has joined the investigation inside
Libya, and we will not rest until the people who orchestrated this attack are found and punished.
It is also important to look at this strategically and understand what is going on across the region.
In a number of places where protests have tuned violent, we are seeing the hand of extremists
who are trying to exploit people's inflamed passions for their own agendas. But overwhelmingly,
we have found that the people of Egypt, of Libya, of Yemen and Tunisia are not prepared to
trade the tyranny of a dictator for the tyranny of a mob. They want to turn their attention to the
future to provide better opportunities for themselves and their children, and they want a strong
partnership with the United States and the American people based on mutual interests and mutual
respect.
This is part of a larger debate that is going on inside these societies. In Libya, for example, in
their first free elections, moderates were successful at the polls. But look, there are extremists in
all of these societies and on the outside who are working to take advantage of broad outrage in
order to incite violence and specifically incite violence against Americans and American
facilities.
And as I have said to many of the leaders I have spoken to over the past week, these extremist
efforts are a threat to the people of the societies and the governments of those societies as well as
to the region and the United States. And I think it's important at this moment for leaders to put
themselves on the right side of this debate - to speak out clearly and unequivocally against
violence, whoever incites it or conducts it
And in a struggle like this, there can be no doubt where the United States must stand. We support
those who are fighting for the same values and rights that we believe in - in democracy, in

freedom, in universal rights for men and women, for justice and accountability. And I want to
underscore that the United States will continue to work with partners and allies in the region and
around the world to help bring security to these nations so that the promise of the revolutions that
they experienced can be realized.
And finally, on your specific point about Benghazi, we obviously never talk publicly about
security at any of our missions for obvious reasons. But that said, let me assure you that our
security in Benghazi included a unit of host government security forces, as well as a local guard
force of the kind that we rely on in many places around the world. In addition to the security
outside the compound, we relied on a wall and a robust security presence inside the compound.
And with all of our missions overseas, in advance of September lid', as is done every year, we
did an evaluation on threat streams. And the Office of the Director of National Intelligence has
said we had no actionable intelligence that an attack on our post in Benghazi was planned or
imminent.
But let me state the obvious again. Our diplomats engage in dangerous work, and it's the nature
of diplomacy in fragile societies and conflict zones to be aware of the necessity for security but
to also continue the important diplomatic work that has to go on. There is risk inherent in what
we do and what these brave men and women representing the United States are up against every
single day, and we do our very best to limit that risk by ensuring that our security protocols
reflect the environments in which diplomats work and the threats that they are presented with.
Thank you.
Remarks With Indonesian Foreign Minister Raden Mohammad Marty Muliana
Natalegawa After Their Meeting
September 20, 2012
SECRETARY CLINTON: Good afternoon, everyone. And it's such a pleasure, as always, to
welcome the Indonesian Foreign Minister, and I believe the largest delegation that has ever come
from Indonesia, for the purpose of our third meeting of the U.S.-Indonesia Joint Commission.
This commission is the result of a vision by our two presidents for a comprehensive partnership,
and the agreement to that effect was signed in 2010. Thanks to this partnership, the United States
and Indonesia are working more closely than ever on a range of issues from global security to
clean energy and climate to regional trade and commerce.
And today, Marty and I had the chance to take stock of where our teams have come in the time
of the last year, because we liad our meeting in Bali a year ago. And I must say, I was very
impressed. We covered a great deal today.

But before I start, I'd like to say a few words about the protests in several countries around the
world. We have condemned in the strongest possible terms the violence that has erupted from
these protests. And as I have said, the video that sparked these protests is disgusting and
reprehensible, and the United States Government, of course, had absolutely nothing to do with it.
But there is no justification for violence, and I want to thank the Foreign Minister and his
government for speaking out against violence. We have to look to reasonable people and
responsible leaders everywhere to stand up to extremists who would seek to take advantage of
this moment to commit violent acts against embassies and their fellow countrymen.
Today's meetings have highlighted the strong foundation that we have built together. And one of
our most important concerns is promoting peace and stability in the Asia Pacific. Today, I'm
announcing that the Obama Administration has informed Congress of the potential sale of eight
AH-64D Apache Longbow helicopters to the Indonesian Government. This agreement will
strengthen our comprehensive partnership and help enhance security across the region.
On growth and prosperity, we are increasing our trade relationship that topped $26 billion last
year. Investments in transportation, energy, and infrastructure are creating jobs and supporting
economic growth in both countries. For example, the deal between Lion Air and Boeing alone
represents $21 billion in trade over the next decade. Indonesia's Government has announced half
a trillion dollars in infrastructure improvements, and we recently signed a memorandum of
understanding to make it easier for American companies to bid on these projects.
And yesterday, we signed an agreement for implementing our Millennium Challenge
Corporation Compact with Indonesia. Over the next five years, the United States will invest $600
million in clean energy development, child health and nutrition programs, and efforts to help
make Indonesia's Government more transparent and open.
The United States is also looking forward to Indonesia hosting APEC in 2013, and we are
confident that Indonesia will come to this role with a commitment to promote greater economic
integration across the Asia Pacific.
Both the Foreign Minister and I believe that strong education is essential to compete in a modem
global economy. That's why the United States has expanded the Fulbright Program and
supported partnerships between dozens of American and Indonesian universities. Academic
exchanges between our countries are up and applications from Indonesian students to visit the
United States have increased by one third. USAID has recently expanded its basic education
program to provide $83 million for teacher training and literacy programs for young children.
And we're providing $20 in scholarship funding for Indonesian graduate students.

I also thanked the Minister for Indonesia's leadership in ASEAN. The Foreign Minister's
personal leadership has helped lay the groundwork for diplomacy between ASEAN and China as
it relates to the South China Sea. And we continue to support ASEAN's six-point principles,
which we believe will help reduce tensions and pave the way for a comprehensive code of
conduct for addressing disputes without threats, coercion, or use of force.
Finally. Indonesia and the United States have stood together on a range of global challenges,
from democratic reform in Burma to combating climate change, to working to end the violence
in Syria. We are also coordinating efforts to further develop south-south and triangular
cooperation, such as enhancing disaster preparedness in Burma and convening a conference on
women's empowerment.
We believe that as the second and third-largest democracies in the world, the United States and
Indonesia have a special responsibility to promote democracy and human rights. And for the last
four years, Indonesia has hosted the Bali Democracy Forum to promote peaceful, democratic
transitions through example and open dialogue. Last year, more than 80 countries attended. And
once again, the United States will be sending a high-level delegation.
So, Minister, thank you for everything. Thank you for the great partnership we've had between
us and between our countries.
MS. NULAND: We'll take two questions today, we'll start with Ros Jordan of Al Jazeera
English.
QUESTION: Thank you, Madam Secretary, Mr. Foreign Minister. Madam Secretary, my
question is about the ongoing investigation into last week's attack at the consulate in Benghazi.
You are meeting this afternoon with members of Congress to discuss the progress and the
concerns that they understandably have. First, there is the federal mandate to establish an
accountability review board. Have you done so? Who would you like to see chair it? Are there
certain questions that you desperately want to have answered in order to safeguard the safety of
Foreign Service Officers around the world?
And related to this, given the political instability and the successes of the past year and a half, are
you satisfied that in light of those political changes, enough was done to protect those working in
the Middle East and North Africa? And then finally â€” and this is perhaps going into the area of
rumor and speculation â€” but there is at least one report suggesting that Ambassador Stevens felt
that he was on a, quote, ""al-Qaida hit list"" Is this a scurrilous rumor? Is this gallows humor
when one is working in a period of difficulty and great challenge, or is there something more to
what he allegedly â€” and I stress that word â€” said?

SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, first, let me say I'm looking forward to the opportunity to go
up to the Congress today. I will be briefing in two separate sessions, the House and the Senate, in
a classified setting, along with my interagency colleagues, as we continue to work together, and
with governments around the world, to ensure that our people and our facilities are safe. I will be
joined today by the Director of National Intelligence, General Clapper, by the Deputy Secretary
of Defense, Ash Carter, by the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Sandy Winnefeld,
along with experts from the FBI, the State Department, and elsewhere in the government.
Now, I anticipate that this briefing will cover our security posture before and during the events,
and the steps we have taken since to do everything we can with host governments to protect our
people and our embassies and consulates. The Director of National Intelligence will speak to the
intelligence issues surrounding these events in Libya. Deputy Secretary Carter will brief on the
superb support we have had from the U.S. military in the wake of these events, and we are at the
very early stages of an FBI investigation. The team from the FBI reached Libya earlier this week.
And I will advise Congress also that I am launching an accountability review board that will be
chaired by Ambassador Thomas Pickering.
I will also talk about the importance of the broader relationships with these countries in light of
the events of the past days. There are obviously very real challenges in these new democracies,
these fragile societies, but as I said last week, the vast majority of the people in these countries
did not throw off the tyranny of a dictator to trade it for the tyranny of a mob. And we are
concerned first and foremost with our own people and facilities, but we are concerned about the
internal security in these countries because ultimately, that puts at risk the men, women, and
children of these societies on a daily ongoing basis if actions are not taken to try to restore
security and civil order.
And let me just conclude by saying that there can be no doubt where the United States stands.
We continue to support those who are fighting for universal values â€” values that we see at work
in Indonesia â€” the third largest democracy in the world. We believe that these values of universal
rights, of justice and accountability, of democracy, are there for every person regardless of where
that person might live. So I will look forward to having a chance to talk with members of
Congress.
As to your final question, I have absolutely no information or reason to believe that there's any
basis for that.
QUESTION: Thank you.
MS. NULAND: Last question. Victoria Sidjabat from Tempo Magazine, please.
QUESTION: Yes. Madam, thank you. My question is: Starting today, U.S. Embassy and
Consulate are closed in Indonesia as the Muslim movie become wild fireball, which could be

designed as a weapon to attack U.S. by raising sentiment anti-U.S. from the countries which has
Muslim majority population like Indonesia.
Madam Clinton, how do you see this threat as on the long run? If it's continuing happen, it's â€”
obviously could give impact to the implementation of (inaudible) program in Indonesia. What is
the reason U.S. Government closed the Embassy and Consulate in Indonesia? What is your
expectation from Indonesia Government, for my Minister Marty Natalegawa? How Indonesia
Government respond to the closing of this Embassy and Consulate, it's starting today? Is U.S. â€”
Indonesia Government has capability to protect U.S. Embassy and Consulate. So the (inaudible)
program implemented â€” could be implemented successfully in Indonesia. Thank you.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, let me begin by saying how grateful we are for the excellent
cooperation we have received from the Government of Indonesia, and in particular, from the law
enforcement and security institutions in Indonesia. We are very grateful for not only the
cooperation and protection that has been provided to our facilities, but also to the strong
statements condemning violence from the President, the Foreign Mihister, and others.
In consultation with the Government of Indonesia, we have temporarily, for tomorrow, closed
our facilities. We want to be sure that law enforcement in Indonesia has the ability to do what it
needs to do to make sure that there is no disruption of civil order and security. So we are
cooperating completely, and we're very grateful for the strong leadership provided by Indonesia.
FOREIGN MINISTER NATALEGAWA: Hello, (inaudible), if I may just also respond.
Precisely as the Secretary had said, the decision by the United States Government to close
temporarily its embassies and consulates tomorrow in Indonesia is a decision that's been made
based on communication and conversation between the authorities in Indonesia and the United
States as well. So in other words, it is an informed decision, a decision that is not intended to
show any unfriendly intent on the part of anyone, but it is what it is, and it's quite some â€” it's the
kind of step that governments actually carry out when situations requires it, even in our case.
Some of our embassies abroad, when the situation requires us to have a temporary closing of the
embassy, we do that as well. So it is something that is quite regular and something that is
actually coordinated as well.
But if I may just broaden the subject matter, I think as our President had said in the past,
Indonesian Government the Indonesian people, even, obviously cannot and would not condone
the â€” any acts of violence against diplomatic premises, against diplomatic personnel, because
that is, truly â€” would be a challenge to the efficient and a proper conduct of relations among
states. So that's our point of departure.
At the same time, of course, beyond the immediate issue of protection of the embassies, we have
still ahead of us the challenge of how to prevent the kind of situations where we are now at in

terms of the kind of incendiary and the kind of statements or, in this instance, films that cause â€”
that is now we have all deplored and condemned for these kind of activities not to be repeated.
So we have a lot of homework to work towards in the future as well.

Remarks With Pakistani Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar Before Their Meeting
September 21, 2012
Good afternoon, and let me begin by welcoming Foreign Minister Khar on her first visit to
Washington as foreign minister. We've had the opportunity to meet in Islamabad and other
settings, but I am very pleased that we would have this chance to exchange views on our bilateral
relationship as well as regional and global issues.
I want to begin by addressing the events of the day and the past week. Today, we've once again
seen protests in several cities in Pakistan. Unfortunately, some of those protests have turned
violent and, sadly, resulted in loss of life. I want to thank the Government of Pakistan for their
efforts to protect our Embassy in Islamabad and consulates in Lahore, Peshawar, and Karachi.
And I want to be clear, as I have said on numerous occasions, the violence we have seen cannot
be tolerated. There is no justification for violence. Of course, there is provocation, and we have
certainly made clear that we do not in any way support provocation. We found the video that's at
the core of this series of events offensive, disgusting, reprehensible.
But that does not provide justification for violence, and therefore it is important for responsible
leaders, indeed responsible people everywhere, to stand up and speak out against violence and
particularly against those who would exploit this difficult moment to advance their own
extremist ideologies.
Yesterday afternoon when I briefed the Congress, I made it clear that keeping our people
everywhere in the world safe is our top priority. What happened in Benghazi was a terrorist
attack, and we will not rest until we have tracked down and brought to justice the terrorists who
murdered four Americans. And we are taking aggressive measures at all of our posts to protect
our staffs and their families along with locally employed people who provide so many important
contributions to the work of our missions.
The Foreign Minister and I will have a chance to cover a full range of subjects today, and it is no
secret that the past year and a half has been challenging for Pakistan and the United States. And
we still have work to do to get our bilateral relationship to the point where we would like it to be,
but we both recognize that we can achieve more when we work together on a focused agenda. So

today is the latest in a series of high-level meetings. Ambassador Marc Grossman has just
returned from consultations in Islamabad. I look forward to seeing President Zardari next week
at the UN General Assembly. At each meeting, we are working to identify the strategic goals we
share â€” and there are many â€” and the concrete actions we can each take to accomplish them.
Our number one shared priority remains pursuing our joint counterterrorism objectives to ensure
the security of American and Pakistani citizens alike. We face a common threat from a common
enemy, and we must confront terrorism and extremism together. Earlier this month, I designated
the Haqqani Network as a Foreign Terrorist Organization so we could make full use of every
available legal authority to end their deadly attacks. Pakistan's parliament has called for
expelling foreign fighters so that Pakistan's territory can be fully under control of the Pakistani
Government and cannot be used to launch attacks against other nations.
And the follow-through on this is challenging but necessary, and we look forward to working
with Pakistan as they continue to address these problems. We have both pledged to support a
secure, stable, and prosperous Afghanistan, which is vital for the security of the region. And I
want to thank Foreign Minister Khar for Pakistan's reopening of the NATO supply lines to allow
the movement of goods to Afghanistan.
We will discuss the successful first meeting of the Safe Passage Working Group in Islamabad
which brought together Afghan, Pakistani, and U.S. representatives to advance the peace process
in Afghanistan. The Pakistani Government's public call for insurgents to come forward and talk
with the Afghan Government was particularly important. We are ready to work together to build
on these steps, and we will continue our discussions through bilateral consultations and the U.S.-
Afghanistan-Pakistan Core Group.
Now, of course, our relationship goes far beyond our shared security concerns, and today we will
discuss the many other ways in which we work together, particularly to create economic
opportunity for Pakistanis. Foreign Minister Khar and I agree that we need to shift our economic
relationship from aid to trade and investment. We are working to help Pakistan attract more
private sector investment. We hope to finalize a bilateral investment treaty soon. And we've
created a Pakistan private investment initiative to help more of Pakistan's small and medium
sized companies get access to capital.
Over the past few years, we have seen Pakistan's civilian government begin to put down stronger
roots. And if elections proceed as planned next year, it will mark the first time in Pakistan's
history that a civilian-led government has served its full term. The United States supports
Pakistan's economic development, and we have said many times that we want to see democracy
succeed in Pakistan.

We also support Pakistan's sovereignty, but we are clear that all sovereign nations carry certain
obligations to protect the human rights of their citizens, to control their territory, to prevent
threats to their neighbors and the international community.
So we know that there is still much to be done, but I can assure the people of Pakistan that the
United States remains committed to this important relationship and we are confident we can
continue to move forward together one step at a time to reach our shared strategic objectives.
Thank you very much.
Remarks With Tunisian Foreign Minister Rank Abdessalem Before Their Meeting
September 21, 2012
SECRETARY CLINTON: Good morning. I am pleased to welcome the Foreign Minister from
Tunisia I'm looking forward to our meeting, We obviously have a great deal to discuss, and I
want to thank the Foreign Minister and the Government of Tunisia for their efforts over the last
week to help secure our Embassy and the American Cooperative School of Tunis following the
violent assaults of last Friday.
We are monitoring events closely today. There is no higher priority for President Obama and
myself than the safety of our people. We've taken a number of steps around the world to
augment security and to protect our personnel at diplomatic posts. And we are working closely
with host governments in this effort.
As I have said before and as is embodied in the Vienna Convention and other international
agreements, all governments have the duty, the solemn duty, to defend diplomatic missions.
They must be safe and protected places so that governments can exchange views and work on
many important issues, and leaders across the world must stand up and be counted in rejecting
violence and holding violent actors accountable.
We are working closely with the Government of Tunisia They have assisted us in enhancing the
security of our facilities. We've also discussed with them the imperative of bringing to justice
those responsible for these violent attacks. And we have offered and will continue to look for
ways that we can assist the new Government of Tunisia in ensuring the rule of law throughout
their country, first and foremost for the people of Tunisia themselves. We look forward to
continuing to build our hew partnership with the Tunisian Government and people. Our
relationship is built around the shared principles of all democracies â€” a commitment to
nonviolence, to tolerance, and inclusivity for all people, and to upholding the rule of law.
The Tunisian people have bravely put themselves on the road to democracy. They were the first
of the Arab revolutions and they have made important progress in a very short period of time.
They have worked too hard and sacrificed too much over too many years to see their progress
hijacked at derailed by extremists with Ulric own a5,-.

Tunisia but in too many places around the world, look for opportunities to exploit this current
situation or other situations, and all people and leaders must stand against them.
So as the Tunisian Government takes steps to strengthen security and protect the Tunisian people
and economy from extremism and violent agendas, the United States stands ready to help. We
also are working closely with Tunisia on the broader shared threat of terrorism, including from
groups like al-Qaida and its affiliates.
So Minister, please know the United States remains committed to supporting Tunisia as you deal
with this current situation, as you continue your democratic transition, and we want to be with
you as you confront challenges and help seize opportunities together for the betterment of the
future of Tunisia.

Subject: Quick readout from Jeff Feitman in Tried
Jeff asked me to pass along the following readout. Please excuse the free-form list of subjects but I wanted to get this
out quickly to as wide an audience as possible. Please feel free to share with others I've missed.
1. State of Embassy Tripoli facility: While admitting he is no engineer, Jeff agrees with the initial OBO assessment
that the facility is not salvageable â€” the condition is ""shocking and photos doesn't do it justice.' Floors have
collapsed, the ballistic glass and metal support beams have melted, and it has been totally trashed. Jeff asked
for their help on Embassy security; they took this on board but noted that they are still in the process of trying to
secure the country.
2. Abdel JAI and Mahmoud fibril both to NY next week: Both will travel to NY next week for the high level
meeting on the 20th. Jain will then return to Libya, and Jibril will remain in NY to deliver the Libyan address to
UNGA on the 24th. The plan is to have the new cabinet in place by the 2e,with Jibril the likely PM. Jeff pressed
them on including a woman on their UN delegation. He also made all of the points about the need for the INC
to take the lead in NY in outlining what they are seeking from the int'l community but they didn't share their
ideas about what they will say.
Action needed: Jalil needs a visa,
understand MAG is working this now but we will need to facilitate issuance (likely by Embassy Tunis).
1 Saadi Qadhafl and Niger: Jibril has sent a letter to Niamey and is sending the Deputy FM there to talk about
Saadi. The Libyan request to Niger will be two-fold: 1. Detain him properly (they understand he is free to roam
about 2. Be prepared to return him to Libya to stand trial.
4. Weapons issues: They will ask OPCW to come back and they want them to say yes but the Libyans are picking
up noises from OPCW that they can't accept a request from the INC now because the INC is not a UN
member. (comment: I know the credentials issue is being worked this week in NY but Ken Ward please convey
to OPCW that they need to take the Libyans up on their request asap.)
S. OUP mandate: they think NATO should stay beyond an additional 30 days (I told Jeff I thought we were now
looking at 90 in any case).
6. Pan Am 103: Jeff raised the issue with Jaill and the Justice Minister, which they took on board; Justice Minister
said ""this was a crime against humanity so Libya has to cooperate.""
7. Treatment of Libyans of color and African migrants: Jeff raised and they responded with the right things.
8. Oil fund paper: Passed to INC.
9. ""Boots on the ground"": they asked about the comments they had seen and expressed their concern over
them. Jeff explained that these were people to help provide security for our people and facility and why they
were necessary.

T hanks for the kind words. I think the Secretary's visit here was picture perfect given the chaos we labor under in
Libya.The Secretary was great and her efforts will I think help us move forward on our project to help the war-wounded.
On a lighter note, I will never be lonely here after the Secretary was kind enough to give my personal contact
information to all 120,000 students at the university during her stirring dialogue with them. It has been quite a week ;I
don't think I can take any more excitement. All the best, Gene.

From: Sid
Re: Morsi's private conversations & coordination with Magariaf
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the
highest levels of European governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1. Late in the day on September 14, 2012, Egyptian President Moharriad. Morsi told senior
European diplomats that he is increasingly concerned the current anti-U.S. and anti-Western violence
spreading through Cairo and into the rest of Egypt may be part of an effort by his Salafist political
rivals to destabilize his government, which many of them believe is too moderate in its positions
regarding Islam, Israel, and the non-Muslim world. According to this source, Morsi, who is in
Brussels for meetings with the European Union (EU), was particularly concerned over a message from
Army commander General Abdel Fatah al-Sissi, that Islamist guerrillas, believed to be drawn
primarily from the Sawarki Bedouin tribe, had launched an attack on a base of the International
Peacekeeping Force (IPF) in the Sinai. The General reported that the 1500 United Nations troops at
the base, including some U.S. forces, were under heavy attack and casualty figures were not yet
known. Morsi stated that this fight was an example of radical anti-government forces and Salafist
Islamist dissidents taking advantage of the current situation to carry out attacks that demonstrate his
government is unable to protect Western personnel and facilities in Egypt. Morsi stated that the
success or failure of his regime is directly tied to his ability to establish a moderate Islamic state that
can work with western business interests.

2. (Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, the current wave of violence is related
to an ongoing struggle between Salafist and Sufi Muslims throughout Egypt. What makes it more
frustrating for Morsi is that much of the violence appears to be inspired by members of the Salafist al
Nour Party, the coalition partner of Morsi's Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) in the new Egyptian
Parliament. According to this individual, Morsi delayed condemning the initial attacks on the U.S.
Embassy out of concern that his opponents would use such a statement to move against his
government. Late on the evening of September 13, 2012, Mohammed Badie, the Supreme Guide of
the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood (MB), sent a message to Morsi warning that he and the Supreme
Guidance Council were concerned that the situation around the U.S. Embassy was getting out of
control and that, difficult as it might seem, he had to take tough measures against the demonstrators,
and protect the interests of the U.S. and other Western Governments. In a telephone discussion with
Saadi al-Katany, the MB/Freedom and Justice Party (MB/FJP) Speaker of the lower house of
parliament, Morsi admitted that he had felt constrained from acting, given his past history of poor
personal relations with the leaders of al Nour. Al-Katany urged him to gain control of the situation.)
3. On September 14, Morsi also stated to an EU official that he had received extremely forceful
messages from both the U.S. State Department and the Office of the U.S. President, leaving no doubt
in his mind that the U.S. â€”Egyptian relations and more than $ibillion in U.S. aid were at stake in this
matter. Morsi added that since much of this aid goes to the Egyptian Army, he and al-Katany agreed
that actions that put it in jeopardy would also damage the new Egyptian administration's current
good relationship with the Army. Accordingly, Morsi instructed the military and security forces to use
all necessary force short of lethal measures to protect U.S. and Western facilities. In a private
conversation, Morsi stated that he felt he is losing control of the political situation and fears that if the
current fighting results in deaths, either of demonstrators, U.S. diplomats, Egyptian security
personnel, or UN peacekeepers, the situation may spin out of control and his government could fall.
Al-Katany agreed, but said that taking no action would guarantee disaster. They agreed that when the
situation calms down they will have to deal with the al Nour party, which they fear will, in the future,
take advantage of circumstances to try to destabilize Morsi's administration. With this in mind, Morsi
ordered al-Sissi to direct the commanders of Military Intelligence (MI -Mukhabarat el-Khabeya) to
step up operations collecting information on the activities of the al Nour leadership, focusing on any
contacts with potentially violent Salafist dissidents.
4.(Source Comment: A separate sensitive source also noted that General al-Sissi is warning
Morsi about press reports that the person who made the controversial internet film at the heart of this
situation is an Egyptian Coptic Christian. The General cautioned that as this report gains wider
circulation, the government and the Army must prepare for violent attacks by Islamists against that
community, which makes up ten (10) percent of the Egyptian population.)
5. A separate sensitive source noted that for his part, al-Sissi is prepared to to have his troops
take harsh measures against any demonstrators who attack Western personnel and facilities. The
General is also concerned that the al Nour leaders are even more dangerous than Morsi realizes, and
he has ordered the MI to increase technical and physical surveillance of these individuals. In
addition, he stated in private that Morsi and al-Katany spoke with Libyan President Mohammed
Yussef el Magariaf, and they had all agreed that military and security officials in Egypt and Libya will
cooperate in an effort to track links between the violence in Cairo and Benghazi. Al-Sissi has ordered
Special Forces units to step up patrols in the Egypt-Libya border region, while the MI will monitor
communications between dissidents; primarily Salafists, in both countries. According to this source
the General is convinced that these dissidents are seizing the opportunity presented by the current
unrest to move against the governments of Morsi and al-Magariaf. He also received permission from
Morsi to step up cooperation with his counterparts in the U.S. and Western Europe to deal with this

situation and al-Sissi believes al-Magariaf has given similar instructions to Libyan military and
security officials.
6. (Source Comment: According to a separate sensitive source, al-Sissi believes that, given his
new orders from Morsi, the Army can, for the most part, protect Western facilities and personnel in
Egypt. But the General is concerned that the security services can never completely eliminate the
threat from small well organized bands looking to carry out terrorist attacks. Following discussion
with Libyan security officials he believes they have the same concerns.)

SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS. NO FOIA WAIVER.
We, the undersigned, are deeply troubled by reports that you may be considering Ambassador Susan
Rice to succeed Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State. Though Ambassador Rice has been our Representative to
the U.N., we believe her misleading statements over the days and weeks following the attack on our embassy in
Libya that led to the deaths of Ambassador Stevens and three other Americans caused irreparable damage to her
credibility both at home and around the world.
In her interviews over that time, Ambassador Rice propagated a falsehood that the attacks were
""spontaneous,"" the outcome of a protest ""spun out of control,"" and the result of a YouTube video. Only on
September 19â€” eight days after the attack â€” did the American people learn from National Counterterrorism
Director Matthew Olsen that the intelligence services considered the attack an act of terrorism and that al Qaeda
may have played a role.
Ambassador Rice is widely viewed as having either willfully or incompetently misled the American
public in the Benghazi matter. Her actions plausibly give U.S. allies (and rivals) abroad reason to question U.S.
commitment and credibility when needed. Thus, we believe that making her the face of U.S. foreign policy in
your second term would greatly undermine your desire to improve U.S. relations with the world and continue
your trust with the American people.
As you know, there have been repeated Congressional requests for information on the events of
September 11, 2012. Over the past month, our Senate colleagues have sent 13 separate letters to senior
Administration officials, including to you. Many Members of the House of Representatives have also sent
letters requesting answers. Our questions remain unanswered, and your Administration continues to deny
Congress access to critical information necessary for effective oversight.
Recent reports of discrepancies between the Department of Defense and the Central Intelligence
Agency's public timelines of the events on September 11 only exacerbate the problem, and we believe these
inconsistencies deserve closer examination.
In light of this troubling situation and the continued unanswered questions, we strongly oppose any
efforts to nominate Ambassador Susan Rice for the position of Secretary of State.
Sincerely,
Members of Congress

today. I was with some NEA hands who knew Chris well and they all noted the Secretary's visit to their offices earlier in

Re: Libyan leadership and militias
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the
highest levels of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1.During the last week of December 2011, and the first week of 2012, Libya's Prime Minister
Abdurrahina el-Keib and President Mustafa Abdul Jai engaged in a series of emergency planning
meetings attempting to deal with specific issues threatening the stability of the new National
Transitional Council (NTC) Government According to extremely sensitive sources speaking in strict
confidence, paramount among these issues are the questions of disarming and rewarding the regional
militias who bore the majority of the fighting against the regime of Muammar al Qaddafi, as well as
the related issue of finding ministers and senior administrators for the new government who are
acceptable to these revolutionary forces. These individuals noted that on four occasions, beginning on
December 23, 2011, groups or angry militiamen came to el-Keib's office and demanded better
treatment, a clear message of support for the role of Islamic law, and the removal of former Qaddafi
advisors from the new government
2. (Source Comment: In the opinion of a very sensitive source, el-Keib is genuinely concerned
that this situation could spiral out of control and threatens the regime. He also suspects that much of
the unrest is being stirred by General Abdel Hakim Mamin Belhaj and his conservative Islamist
supporters. By staying out of the new government, Belhaj has established a position from which he
can criticize their actions and appointments without concern or control, That said, el â€” Keib has been
told by his contacts in the Moslem Brotherhood (MB) that even Belhaj has been surprised that the
unrest in the militias has begun to manifest itself in fighting between groups that previously shared
the same goals and operated under Belhaj's loose command, This is particularly true in the case of
the increasingly violent conflicts between the Misrata and Zintan regional militias.)
3. In an effort to address these problems el-Keib is making changes in his new administration,
removing Minister of Economics Taher Sherkaz, who, as a former economic advisor to Qaddafi, was a

3. In an effort to address these problems el-Keib is making changes in his new administration,
removing Minister of Economics Taher Sherkaz, who, as a former economic advisor to Qaddafi, was a
particular target of the militiamen. In the opinion of well informed individuals, el-Keib's closest and
most influential advisors are experts with economic backgrounds and experience dealing with
Western firms and governments. The most influential of this group are Minister of Oil Abdulrahman
Ben Yaw, Minister of Finance Hassan Ziglam, National Oil Company chief Nuni Berrusien, and Ngeb
Obeda from the Libyan Stock Exchange.
4- (Source Comment: In the opinion of a very sensitive source, el-Keib and Jalil are also very
concerned over growing criticism that these technocrats are puppets of various Western governments
and firms. Belhaj and the militiamen appear intent on limiting the influence of these Western
entities, using them as a weapon to weaken the el-Keib regime. This trend is also affecting national
security, where, despite el-Keib's efforts to maintain a balance between the Islamists, regional
commanders, and the national army, a potentially dangerous conflict has arisen over the position of
Chief of Staff of the National Army. El-Kieb, according to this individual, believes that he must settle
this matter in short order to avoid provoking security concerns among foreign allies and businesses
'contacts.)
5. According to a knowledgeable individual, in late December 2011e1-Kieb resisted efforts by
General Khalifa Belqasim Haftar to establish himself as the Chief of Staff of the National Army.
Haftar, who lived in the United States for many years and is believed by Belhaj and others to have a
relationship with the U.S. Government, is using his popularity among the officer corps of the regular
NTC army to support his claim to be Chief of Staff. This produced heated protests from militia
leaders and in late December 20 ael-Keib named deputy Minister of Defense Colonel Yussef
Mangoushâ€ž to be Chief of Staff. In the opinion of one source, this is a problematic choice, since el-
Keib is replacing the supposedly pro-American Haftar with al-Mangoush who commanded one of
Qaddafi's elite Special Forces units, even after the revolution began. This individual believes that el-
Keib's decision was driven by personal animosity toward Haftar, and the influence of Minister of
Defense Osama al-Juwali. The situation is far from resolved, as Haftar and his supporters,
particularly in the Benghazi garrison, continue to claim that the General is the true Chief of Staff. El-
Keib and al-Juwali are working to reconcile all of the elements in this conflict as quickly as possible,
before the supporters of the two claimants begin fighting. In the meantime, el-Keib has stated in
private that he fully expects Belhaj to attack al-Mangoush, but the Prime Minister believes that the
Colonel is the only officer strong enough to disarm the militias and avoid a civil war.
6. At the same time, a very sensitive source added that el-Keib and Jail are attempting to
reconcile the fighting between Misrata and Zintan forces in Tripoli by naming Misrata leader Fawzi
Abd Ali as Minister of the Interior and al-Juwali, who was commander of the Zintan militia, as
Minister of Defense. To date, according to this individual, this effort has met with limited success, as
the fighting has continued and the militias are refusing to disarm until their demands regarding living
standards are met.
7. (Source Comment: One very sensitive source noted, that el-Keib is aware of the fact that he
is running out of time to stabilize the situation in Libya. He believes that if he does not disarm the
militias and meet their demands in the next six months there is a good chance of increased fighting
among rival groups that could lead to civil war. In any event, he realizes that the ongoing instability
will cause Western governments, firms, and banks, to hesitate before committing themselves to long
term relationships with Libya. El-Keib believes that Belhaj and his advisors have made the same
judgment, and are waiting to fill any vacuum created by this violence, by establishing a conservative
Islamic Republic.)

David Petraeus will testify on Benghazi
By KATIE GLUECK I 11/14/12 9:32 AM EST Updated: 11/14/12 9:54 AM EST
Gen. David Petraeus will testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein told POLITICO
Wednesday morning. But the exact schedule has not been set for his testimony.
""Mr. Petraeus has indicated his willingness [to testify]. He is eager to come before the committee so we will work out the details,"" Feinstein said.
Earlier Wednesday, Fox New reported that the former director of the CIA who resigned last week over an extramarital affair, will still testify voluntarily on Friday
before congressional intelligence committees regarding the Sept, 11 attack on the U.S. diplomatic facility in Benghazi, Libya.
Petraeus was initially slated to offer testimony on Benghazi at closed hearings before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday.
Feinstein, the chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said on CNN's ""The Situation Room"" on Tuesday that she believed Petraeus would eventually
appear before the committee because he is a ''responsible person.""

Re: Libyan leadership and militias
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the
highest levels of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1. During the last week of December 2011, and the first week of 2012, Libya's Prime Minister
Abdurrahim el-Keib and President Mustafa Abdul Jail engaged in a series of emergency planning
meetings attempting to deal with specific issues threatening the stability of the new National
Transitional Council (NTC) Government. According to extremely sensitive sources speaking in strict
confidence, paramount among these issues are the questions of disarming and rewarding the regional
militias who bore the majority of the fighting against the regime of Muaimnar al Qaddafi, as well as
the related issue of finding ministers and senior administrators for the new government who are
acceptable to these revolutionary forces. These individuals noted that on four occasions, beginning on
December 23, 2011, groups or angry militiamen came to el-Keib's office and demanded better
treatment, a clear message of support for the role of Islamic law, and the removal of former Qaddafi
advisors from the new government.
2. (Source Comment: In the opinion of a very sensitive source, el-Keib is genuinely concerned
that this situation could spiral out of control and threatens the regime. He also suspects that much of
the unrest is being stirred by General Abdel Hakim Alamin Belhaj and his conservative Islamist

unrest in the militias has begun to manifest itself in fighting between groups that previously shared
the same goals and operated under Belhars loose command. This is particularly true in the case of
the increasingly violent conflicts between the Misrata and Zintan regional militias.)
3. In an effort to address these problems el-Keib is making changes in his new administration,
removing Minister of Economics Taher Sherkaz, who, as a former economic advisor to Qaddafi, was a
particular target of the militiamen. In the opinion of well informed individuals, el-Keib's closest and
most influential advisors are experts with economic backgrounds and experience dealing with
Western firms and governments. The most influential of this group are Minister of Oil Abdulrahman
Ben Yezza, Minister of Finance Hassan Ziglam, National Oil Company chief Nuni Berrusien, and Nge,b
Obeda from the Libyan Stock Exchange.
4. (Source Comment: In the opinion of a very sensitive source, el-Keib and Jail are also very
concerned over growing criticism that these technocrats are puppets of various Western governments
and firms. Belhaj and the militiamen appear intent on limiting the influence of these Western
entities, using them as a weapon to weaken the el-Keib regime. This trend is also affecting national
security, where, despite el-Keib's efforts to maintain a balance between the Islamists, regional
commanders, and the national army, a potentially dangerous conflict has arisen over the position of
Chief of Staff of the National Army. El-Kieb, according to this individual, believes that he must settle
this matter in short order to avoid provoking security concerns among foreign allies and businesses
contacts.)
5. According to a knowledgeable individual, in late December 2011e1-Kieb resisted efforts by
General Khalifa Belqasim Haftar to establish himself as the Chief of Staff of the National Army.
Haftar, who lived in the United States for many years and is believed by Belhaj and others to have a
relationship with the U.S. Government, is using his popularity among the officer corps of the regular
NTC army to support his claim to be Chief of Staff. This produced heated protests from militia
leaders and in late December 20liel-Keib named deputy Minister of Defense Colonel Yussef al-
Mangoush, to be Chief of Staff. In the opinion of one source, this is a problematic choice, since el-
Keit) is replacing the supposedly pro-American Haftar with al-Mangoush who commanded one of
Qaddafi's elite Special Forces units, even after the revolution began. This individual believes that el-
Keib's decision was driven by personal animosity toward Haftar, and the influence of Minister of
Defense Osama al-Juwali. The situation is far from resolved, as Haftar and his supporters,
particularly in the Benghazi garrison, continue to claim that the General is the true Chief of Staff. El-
Keib and al-Juwali are working to reconcile all of the elements in this conflict as quickly as possible,
before the supporters of the two claimants begin fighting. In the meantime, el-Keib has stated in
private that he fully expects Belhaj to attack al-Mangoush, but the Prime Minister believes that the
Colonel is the only officer strong enough to disarm the militias and avoid a civil war.
6. At the same time, a very sensitive source added that el-Keib and Jalil are attempting to
reconcile the fighting between Misrata and Zintan forces in Tripoli by naming Misrata leader Fawzi
Abd All as Minister of the Interior and al-Juwali, who was commander of the Zintan militia, as
Minister of Defense. To date, according to this individual, this effort has met with limited success, as
the fighting has continued and the militias are refusing to disarm until their demands regarding living
standards are met.
7, (Source Comment: One very sensitive source noted, that el-Keib is aware of the fact that he
is running out of time to stabilize the situation in Libya. He believes that if he does not disarm the
militias and meet their demands in the next six months there is a good chance of increased fighting
among rival groups that could lead to civil war. In any event, he realizes that the ongoing instability
will cause Western governments, firms, and banks, to hesitate before committing themselves to long

Islamic Republic.)

Re: Libyan leadership and militias
SOURCE. Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as
the highest levels of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services,
1. During the last week of December 2011, and the first week of 2012, Libya's Prime
Minister Abdurrahim el-Keib and President Mustafa Abdul Jalil engaged in a series of
emergency planning meetings attempting to deal with specific issues threatening the stability of
the new National Transitional Council (NTC) Government. According to extremely sensitive
sources speaking in strict confidence, paramount among these issues are the questions of
disarming and rewarding the regional militias who bore the majority of the fighting against the
regime of Muammar al Qadclafi, as well as the related issue of finding ministers and senior
administrators for the new government who are acceptable to these revolutionary forces. These
individuals noted that on four occasions, beginning on December 23, 2011, groups or angry
militiamen came to el-ICeib's office and demanded better treatment, a clear message of support
for the role of Islamic law, and the removal of former Qaddafi advisors from the new
government.
2, (Source Comment: In the opinion of a very sensitive source, el-Keib is genuinely
concerned that this situation could spiral out of control and threatens the regime. He also
suspects that much of the unrest is being stirred by General Abdel Hakim Alamin Belhaj and his
conservatiti'e Islamist supporters. By staying out of the new government, Belhaj has established
a position from which he can criticize their actions and appointments without concern or control.
That said, el â€” Keib has been told by his contacts in the Moslem Brotherhood (MB) that even
Belhaj has been surprised that the unrest in the militias has begun to manifest itself in fighting

Libyans march against Islamist militias in Benghazi
By Peter Graff and Suleiman Al-Khalidi
BENGHAZI, Libya l Fri Sep 21, 2012 2:23pm EDT
(Reuters) - Thousands of Libyans marched in Benghazi on Friday in support of democracy and against the
Islamist militias that Washington blames for an attack on the U.S. consulate last week that killed four
Americans including the ambassador.
The ""Rescue Benghazi day"" demonstration called for the government to disband armed groups that have refused
to give up their weapons since the NATO-backed revolution that toppled Muammar Gaddafi last year
Marchers headed for a main square where a much smaller counter demonstration of hundreds of supporters of
hardline Islamist group Ansar al-Sharia were waiting.
""Ifs obvious that this protest is against the militias. All of them should join the army or security forces as
individuals, not as groups,"" medical student Ahmed Sanallah, 27, said. ""Without that there will be no prosperity
and no success for the new Libya.""
The late afternoon demonstration had a cheerful atmosphere as families marched with small children on their
shoulders.
Fighter jets and helicopters roared overhead in a show of official support for the demonstration, which has been
enthusiastically promoted by the city's authorities.

""Those military battalions that want to impose their ideology on the people of Libya will be confronted,"" Saleh
Gaouda, a member of new ruling national congress, said.
""This city wants to go back to stability and participate in building the state.""
In a sign of the cheerful atmosphere, one car had a giant cardboard model of Benghazi's landmark lighthouse
strapped to the roof. As the sun set and the crowd began to disperse, someone shot fireworks into the air.
""DEFEND BENGHAZI""
Although the main demands of the marchers did not mention the attack on the U.S. consulate, it seems to have
provided a strong impetus for the authorities to rally support behind the country's weak government.
U.S. ambassador Christopher Stevens was well liked in Libya, and many people who were angered by an anti-
Islamic film made in the United States consider the attack on the embassy to have been excessive. Some
placards in English, intended for international news cameras, read: ""We demand justice for Stevens"" and ""Libya
lost a friend"".
""I am out today to defend Benghazi. Killing the ambassador is a completely separate thing,"" 26-year-old Amjad
Mohammed Hassan, a network engineer, said. ""I don't give a damn about the killing of the ambassador because
the Americans offended the Prophet. I am just here for Benghazi.""
Benghazi, 1,000 km (600 miles) from Tripoli across largely empty desert, is controlled by various armed
groups, including some comprised of Islamists who openly proclaim their hostility to democratic government
and the West.
Some of these have been identified by local people as being among those who were at the consulate protest last
week. U.S. officials have described the violence as a ""terrorist attack"".
One group linked to the attack is Ansar al-Sharia, which has denied involvement in the violence.
Abu Al-Qaa, a demonstrator at the Ansar al-Sharia counter demonstration, said Stevens ""was preparing for the
entry of American troops into Libya"".
""The will of the Prophet was to expel infidels from Muslim lands so that Muslims prevail. Terrorizing your
enemy is one of Islam's tenets.""
He said he had fought against American troops in Iraq where he was arrested and sent back to Gaddafi's Libya
and jailed for three years.
One banner at that demonstration read: ""Day to rescue Benghazi or day to rescue America?""
In southern Libya, at least six people were killed and 12 injured in clashes between security forces and a local
group, a security official and a resident said on Friday.
Security forces were sent to the town of Brak, 700 km (400 miles) south of Tripoli, on Wednesday to stop a
group broadcasting songs about Gaddafi on the radio, the official said. The security forces, made up of former
rebel fighters, came under attack upon arrival.

Re: Libyan leadership and militias
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the
highest levels of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1. During the last week of December 2011 and the first week of 2012, Libya's Prime Minister
Abdurrahim el-Keib and President Mustafa Abdul Ja.lil engaged in a series of emergency planning
meetings attempting to deal with specific issues threatening the stability of the new National
Transitional Council (NTC) Government. According to extremely sensitive sources speaking in strict
confidence, paramount among these issues are the questions of disarming and rewarding the regional
militias who bore the majority of the fighting against the regime of Muammar al Qaddafi, as well as
the related issue of finding ministers and senior administrators for the new government who are
acceptable to these revolutionary forces. These individuals noted that on four occasions, beginning on
December 23, 2011, groups or angry militiamen came to el-Keib's office and demanded better

treatment, a clear message of support for the role of Islamic law, and the removal of former Qaddafl
advisors from the new government.
2. (Source Comment: In the opinion of a very sensitive source, el-Keib is genuinely concerned
that this situation could spiral out of control and threatens the regime. He also suspects that much of
the unrest is being stirred by General Abdel Hakim Alamin Belhaj and his conservative Islamist
supporters. By staying out of the new government, Belhaj has established a position from which he
can criticize their actions and appointments without concern or control. That said, el â€” Keib has been
told by his contacts in the Moslem Brotherhood (MB) that even Belhaj has been surprised that the
unrest in the militias has begun to manifest itself in fighting between groups that previously shared
the same goals and operated under Belhaj's loose command. This is particularly true in the case of
the increasingly violent conflicts between the Misrata and Zintan regional militias.)
3. In an effort to address these problems el-Keib is making changes in his new administration,
removing Minister of Economics Taher Sherkaz, who, as a former economic advisor to Qaddafi, was a
particular target of the militiamen. In the opinion of well informed individuals, el-Keib's closest and
most influential advisors are experts with economic backgrounds and experience dealing with
Western firms and governments. The most influential of this group are Minister of Oil Abdulrahman
Ben Yezza, Minister of Finance Hassan Ziglarn, National Oil Company chief Nuni Berrusien, and Ngeb
Obeda from the Libyan Stock Exchange.
4. (Source Comment: In the opinion of a very sensitive source, el-Keib and JAE are also very
concerned over growing criticism that these technocrats are puppets of various Western governments
and firms. Belhaj and the militiamen appear intent on limiting the influence of these Western
entities, using them as a weapon to weaken the el-Keib regime. This trend is also affecting national
security, where, despite el-Keib's efforts to maintain a balance between the Islamists, regional
commanders, and the national army, a potentially dangerous conflict has arisen over the position of
Chief of Staff of the National Army. El-Kieb, according to this individual, believes that he must settle
this matter in short order to avoid provoking security concerns among foreign allies and businesses
contacts.)
5. According to a knowledgeable individual, in late December 2011e1-Kieb resisted efforts by
General Khalith Belqasim Haftar to establish himself as the Chief of Staff of the National Army.
Haftar, who lived in the United States for many years and is believed by Belhaj and others to have a
relationship with the U.S. Government, is using his popularity among the officer corps of the regular
mrcarmy to support his claim to be Chief of Staff. This produced heated protests from militia
leaders and in late December 2011e1-Keib named deputy Minister of Defense Colonel Yussef al-
Mangoush, to be Chief of Staff. In the opinion of one source, this is a problematic choice, since el-
Keib is replacing the supposedly pro-American Haftar with al-Mangoush who commanded one of
Qaddafi's elite Special Forces units, even after the revolution began. This individual believes that el-
Keib's decision was driven by personal animosity toward Haftar, and the influence of Minister of
Defense Osama al-Juwali. The situation is far from resolved, as Haftar and his supporters,
particularly in the Benghazi garrison, continue to claim that the General is the true Chief of Staff. El-
Keib and al-Juwali are working to reconcile all of the elements in this conflict as quickly as possible,
before the supporters of the two claimants begin fighting. In the meantime, el-Keib has stated in
private that he fully expects Belhaj to attack al-Mangoush, but the Prime Minister believes that the
Colonel is the only officer strong enough to disarm the militias and avoid a civil war.
6. At the same time, a very sensitive source added that el-Keib and Jain are attempting to
reconcile the fighting between Misrata and Zintan forces in Tripoli by naming Misrata leader Favvzi
Abd Ali as Minister of the Interior and al-Juwali, who was commander of the Zintan militia, as
Minister of Defense. To date, according to this individual, this effort has met with limited success, as
the fighting has continued and the militias are refusing to disarm until their demands regarding living
standards are met.
7. (Source Comment: One very sensitive source noted, that el-Keib is aware of the fact that he
is running out of time to stabilize the situation in Libya. He believes that if he does not disarm the
militias and meet their demands in the next six months there is a good chance of increased fighting

among rival groups that could lead to civil war. In any event, he realizes that the ongoing instability
will cause Western governments, firms, and banks, to hesitate before committing themselves to long
term relationships with Libya. El-Keib believes that Belhaj and his advisors have made the same
judgment, and are waiting to fill any vacuum created by this violence, by establishing a conservative
Islamic Republic.)

Op-Ed
The world after Petraeus
Obama should seize this chance to adjust his foreign policy.
By Sarah Chayes
November 15, 2012
The scandal enveloping members of America's adulated top brass is the deepest crisis to hit the military in
decades. It is a crisis President Obama did not need â€” shaming the country and increasing his burden during a
major transition on his national security team. And yet, crisis can be a great corrective. Obama should use this
one to reverse one of the most dysfunctional elements of U.S. foreign policy over the last decade: an infatuation
with military solutions to problems that are fundamentally political.
The resignation of former Central Intelligence Agency Director David H. Petraeus after an extramarital affair
came to light, together with expected high-level personnel changes at the State Department and other agencies,
creates a singular opportunity to embark on the complex process of rebalancing U.S. foreign policy in favor of
non-military approaches.
When he first came to office, Obama seemed suspicious of Petraeus, who made his reputation under President
George W. Bush as the general who transformed the military's approach to the Iraq war. The suspicion was
reflected in the fraught National Security Council debate over Afghanistan strategy in 2009. Yet since then,
Obama, like so many others, seems to have been seduced by Petraeus. Not by the man but by what the man
could offer him.
Petraeuss unique political genius over the last decade has been to provide each of two contrasting presidents a
military solution to his key national security problems that was tailored to his character. For Bush, obsessed
with Iraq and with leaving a mark on the Middle East, Petraeus helped design a grandiose, troop-heavy
approach.
With the change of administrations, Petraeus soon saw that Obama and his team were different â€” concerned
about the costs of the inherited wars and about the risks of a runaway military. So while Petraeus continued to
pay lip-service to counterinsurgency doctrine, he veered away from it in practice. His focus as commander of

the troops in Afghanistan â€” and even more so at the CIA â€” was on a type of warfare better suited to this
president: targeted, technologically advanced, secretive killing over which the president could exert control.
But such an approach, though cheaper in resources and American lives, is still flawed. It is still a military
answer to problems that are deeply political in nature and rooted in a complex mix of history, regional and
cultural particularism, and the effects of a protracted abuse of power by elites. By shifting to drones and special
ops as the instruments of choice to combat militant extremism, the U.S. government remains consumed by the
same old questions: How many men and women in uniform, equipped with what kind of hardware, need to
employ which tactics to defeat the enemy?
What atrophied during the years that two U.S. administrations dwelt obsessively on these questions were all the
other tools of U.S. foreign policy, including information-gathering and analysis, diplomacy and economic and
legal leverage.
Perhaps the gravest consequence has been the knowledge deficit. Both wars were hampered by a devastating
lack of situational understanding. In Afghanistan, where I lived and worked for more than eight years, I was
stunned by how long it took U.S. officials to realize that tribes were key to Afghan social structure. U.S.
officials resisted meeting with ordinary Afghans, dealing instead with members of a self-serving and unpopular
government. So, for more than a decade, the U.S. government was operating almost blind.
The first way Obama can constructively harness Petraeus downfall is to reorient the CIA toward its core
function: intelligence-gathering. Of late, a body-count culture has prevailed at the CIA, exemplified by the
secretive drone campaign. If 60 intelligence professionals are assigned to planning and monitoring each drone
in the air, as has been reported, that's 60 who are not on the ground in country, interacting with locals, gaining
an intuitive feel for the dynamics. Obama should resist the temptation to put another target-focused operator at
the helm of the CIA.
Another main civilian component of U.S. power is its diplomacy. Obama should also use this moment of
transition to think through what kind of State Department he really needs. The instruments of U.S. foreign
policy are multiple, varied and subtle in their application. To avail itself of them, the government needs smart,
adaptable, dynamic risk-takers, who think strategically and operate with autonomy. Such people must be
attracted to government service and provided responsibilities commensurate with their talents.
But the other national security topic of the moment threatens to push Obama in the wrong direction. The death
of Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens in Benghazi, Libya, has been politicized in deeply counterproductive
ways. Members of Congress should bear that in mind as they continue examining the details of the attack.
Stevens was exactly the type of diplomat the U.S. government needs: someone with long experience in the
region to which he was posted, an ambassador who engaged with people, gained insight into the environment
and helped influence it. That kind of diplomacy is essential, but it carries risks. If it becomes politically
untenable in Washington for an ambassador to die in the line of duty, then talented diplomats will be hobbled.
And faced with a choked career path, the best will look elsewhere for rewarding work. Obama should appoint a
secretary of State determined to counteract the tendency to retrench.
Perhaps the most important foreign policy challenge Obama faces in his second term is how to expand,
restructure and reinforce the range of civilian instruments of U.S. power. That is a generational task, but one the
current crisis has provided an unparalleled opportunity to tackle.

Re: Libyan leadership and militias
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the
highest levels of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1. During the last week of December 2011, and the first week of 2012, Libya's Prime Minister
Abdurrahim el-Keib and President Mustafa Abdul Jalil engaged in a series of emergency planning
meetings attempting to deal with specific issues threatening the stability of the new National
Transitional Council (NTC) Government. According to extremely sensitive sources speaking in strict
confidence, paramount among these issues are the questions of disarming and rewarding the regional
militias who bore the majority of the fighting against the regime of ivluammar al Qaddafi, as well as
the related issue of finding ministers and senior administrators for the new government who are
acceptable to these revolutionary forces. These individuals noted that on four occasions, beginning on
December 23, 2011, groups or angry militiamen came to el-KeilD's office and demanded better

treatment, a clear message of support for the role of Islamic law, and the removal of former Qaddafi
advisors from the new government.
2, (Source Comment: In the opinion of a very sensitive source, el-Keib is genuinely concerned
that this situation could spiral out of control and threatens the regime. He also suspects that much of
the unrest is being stirred by General Abdel Hakim Alamin Belhaj and his conservative Islamist
supporters. By staying out of the new government, Belhaj has established a position from which he
can criticize their actions and appointments without concern or control. That said, el â€” Keib has been
told by his contacts in the Moslem Brotherhood (MB) that even Belhaj has been surprised that the
unrest in the militias has begun to manifest itself in fighting between groups that previously shared
the same goals and operated under Belhaj's loose command. This is particularly true in the case of
the increasingly violent conflicts between the Misrata and Zintan regional militias.)
3. In an effort to address these problems el-Keib is making changes in his new administration,
removing Minister of Economics Taher Sherkaz, who, as a former economic advisor to Qaddafi, was a
particular target of the militiamen. In the opinion of well informed individuals, el-Keib's closest and
most influential advisors are experts with economic backgrounds and experience dealing with
Western firms and governments. The most influential of this group are Minister of Oil Abdulrahman
Ben Yezza, Minister of Finance Hassan Ziglam, National Oil Company chief Mari Berrusien, and Ngeb
Obecia from the Libyan Stock Exchange.
4. (Source Comment: In the opinion of a very sensitive source, el-Keib and Jai are also very
concerned over growing criticism that these technocrats are puppets of various Western governments
and firms. Belhaj and the militiamen appear intent on limiting the influence of these Western
entities, using them as a weapon to weaken the el-Keib regime. This trend is also affecting national
security, where, despite el-Keib's efforts to maintain a balance between the Islamists, regional
commanders, and the national army, a potentially dangerous conflict has arisen over the position of
Chief of Staff of the National Army. El-Kieb, according to this individual, believes that he must settle
this matter in short order to avoid provoking security concerns among foreign allies and businesses
contacts.)
5. According to a knowledgeable individual, in late December 2011e1-Kieb resisted efforts by
General Khalifa Belqasim Haftar to establish himself as the Chief of Staff of the National
Army. Haftar, who lived in the United States for many years and is believed by Belhaj and others to
have a relationship with the U.S. Government, is using his popularity among the officer corps of the
regular NTC army to support his claim to be Chief of Staff. This produced heated protests from
militia leaders and in late December 2011e1-Keib named deputy Minister of Defense Colonel Yussef al-
Mangoush, to be Chief of Staff. In the opinion of one source, this is a problematic choice, since el-
!Leib is replacing the supposedly pro-American Haftar with al-Mangoush who commanded one of
Qaddafi's elite Special Forces units, even after the revolution began. This individual believes that el-
Keib's decision was driven by personal animosity toward Haftar, and the influence of Minister of
Defense Osama al-Juwali. The situation is far from resolved, as Haftar and his supporters,
particularly in the Benghazi garrison, continue to claim that the General is the true Chief of Staff. El-
Keib and al-Juwali are working to reconcile all of the elements in this conflict as quickly as possible,
before the supporters of the two claimants begin fighting. In the meantime, el- Keib has stated in
private that he fully expects Belhaj to attack al-Mangoush, but the Prime Minister believes that the
Colonel is the only officer strong enough to disarm the militias and avoid a civil war.
6. At the same time, a very sensitive source added that el-Keib and Jalil are attempting to
reconcile the fighting between Misrata and Zintan forces in Tripoli by naming Misrata leader Fawzi
Abd Ali as Minister of the Interior and al-Juwali, who was commander of the Zintan militia, as
Minister of Defense. To date, according to this individual, this effort has met with limited success, as
the fighting has continued and the militias are refusing to disarm until their demands regarding living
standards are met.
7. (Source Comment: One very sensitive source noted, that el-Keib is aware of the fact that he
is running out of time to stabilize the situation in Libya. He believes that if he does not disarm the
militias and meet their demands in the next six months there is a good chance of increased fighting

among rival groups that could lead to civil war. In any event, he realizes that the ongoing instability
will cause Western governments, firms, and banks, to hesitate before committing themselves to long
term relationships with Libya. El-Keib believes that Belhaj and his advisors have made the same
judgment, and are waiting to fill any vacuum created by this violence, by establishing a conservative
Islamic Republic.)

HEADLINE: It's not about Rice
BYLINE: Richard Cohen
BODY:
In 1953, an Army officer by the name of Irving Peress was promoted from captain to major. Peress was a
leftist, possibly a communist, and word of his advancement in rank reached Sen. Joseph McCarthy in
Washington. He asserted that the promotion proved the Army was ""soft on communism,"" and he launched an
investigation that transfixed the nation. Peress, by the way, was a mere dentist. He was the Susan Rice of his
day.
Rice, of course, is a much more substantial figure. She is the U.N. ambassador, a friend of Barack Obama's
and a member of his Cabinet. Still, the attack on her is so disproportionate to what she is accused of having
done - just what was it, exactly? - that as in the Peress case, you have to conclude that there is something more
at work.
At first, I thought we were witnessing just another example of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) doing his
Rumpelstiltskin number - throwing a fit and stomping his feet. It was McCain who first leveled the solemn
charge that Rice had lied to the Sunday TV shows about the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya.
She had characterized it as a spontaneous riot when it was, in fact, a planned attack by a local al-Qaeda affiliate.
But Rice was hewing to the early line established by the intelligence community. If the CIA and others were
wrong - or deceptive - then so, inevitably, was she.
Just as surely as day follows night, McCain's broadside was echoed by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). It
was soon taken up by 97 Republicans in the House who found Rice unqualified to become secretary of state - a
post to which she has not been nominated. ""Ambassador Rice is widely viewed as having willfully or
incompetently misled the American public,"" they bellowed.
I think Rice would make a dandy secretary of state. She's close to the president, and that matters a great
deal. But she is also seen as overly political and that, as much as her version of Benghazi, is what troubles some
others. Oddly enough, Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.), a former presidential candidate and another potential
secretary of state, is seen as much more of a statesmen. He is indeed an independent foreign-policy thinker who
has, as in days of old, restored the prestige and importance of the Foreign Relations Committee, of which he is
chairman.
But the awful truth is that it hardly matters who Obama chooses. Foreign policy is run from the White
House and not the State Department. Hillary Clinton is about to retire, and while she has done a commendable

job at Foggy Bottom, we cannot expect the inevitable book by her to reveal a Clinton Doctrine. For the most
part, she executed, not initiated, foreign policy.
So what is this fuss all about? Not Rice, that's for sure. It has turned instead into an expression of unease
about Obarna's foreign policy and its politicization. The unfortunate Peress came to personify the government's
alleged indifference to the (equally alleged) communist infiltration of the military and virtually everything else
(with the possible exception of the American Legion), Similarly, Rice has become the personification of
unhappiness with the use of intelligence leaks to buff Obanaa's foreign policy image and the conducting of an
amorphous foreign policy. Like Churchill's famous pudding, it lacks theme.
Syria is an example. U.S. inaction has allowed the crisis to fester. Bashar al-Assad's regime might be
dusting off its formidable arsenal of chemical weapons, further evidence of how chaotic this crisis has become,
but much of the time the White House has just trailed after Turkey or France. The war has spread, a refugee
calamity has developed, 40,000 people have died, and jihadists have come to play a prominent role. The Obarna
administration has been as lethargic on Syria as it initially was with Libya.
This sense of an aimless foreign policy, one lacking any moral fervor (or fiber) irritates conservatives much
more than liberals. It certainly enrages McCain, who cannot stomach the big guys kicking little guys around. He
sees an administration that will not engage the American people on matters of foreign policy - make a case for
intervention, not just say it's too hard to do.
The attack on Rice is unfair and excessive. But the issue is not the person but what she represents - in this
case, the administration's 'mobility to articulate a foreign policy that marries American morality to American
power, not merely American politics.

11 attacks on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi were by terrorists. That leaves one VIP who's still missing from
Congressional scrutiny: Hillary Clinton.
GOP Congressman Peter King said Mr. Petraeus's testimony differed from what the former CIA director told
Congress immediately after the attacks., Mr. King also said Mr. Petraeus said that the CIA's original talking
points on the attacks were edited. The altered version became the basis for U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice's
misleading and now infamous comments blaming the attacks on a YouTube video, Both that discrepancy and
the issue of the altered talking points need further digging, especially if Ms. Rice is nominated to be the next
Secretary of State.
But Mr. Petraeus wasn't responsible for lax consulate security or the U.S. policy that led to the Libya debacle.
That's Mrs. Clinton's bailiwick. Last month in interviews from deepest Peru, the Secretary of State said ""I take
responsibility"" for Benghazi.
Except she hasn't. She was conveniently out of the country for this week's House Foreign Affairs hearing, and
Senate Foreign Relations Chairman John Kerry refuses to hold any hearings on Benghazi. His loyalty may get
him a cabinet job, while Carl Levin's Armed Services Committee also pretends nothing much happened in
Libya.

The targets of the attacks and its first victims were diplomats. Chris Stevens died of smoke inhalation in the
blaze, becoming the first American ambassador killed in the line of duty in over 30 years. A junior colleague
also died. These men were Mrs. Clinton's ""responsibility."" Several hours after the assault on the consulate,
members of the jihaclist militia Ansar al-Shariah turned on the CIA compound about a mile away, killing two of
Mr. Petraeus's men.
In Congressional hearings last month, career State officials admitted that threat warnings from Benghazi were
overlooked and requests for better security turned down. They said Foggy Bottom misjudged the ability of a
weak Libyan state to protect them. Ifs not clear how high up the chain these concerns went, but over to you,
Mrs. Clinton.
For over a week after the attacks, the Administration blamed the YouTube video. Mrs. Clinton didn't push this
misleading narrative in public as enthusiastically as Ms. Rice. Still, she bought into it. The father of Tyrone
Woods, a CIA contractor who was killed in Benghazi, told media outlets last month that Mrs. Clinton tried to
comfort him by promising that the U.S.-based maker of the video would be ""prosecuted and arrested""â€”though
terrorists killed his son.
Beyond the Benghazi attacks is the larger issue of the Administration's Libya policy, a failure that Mrs. Clinton
should also answer for. At the start of the Libya uprising, Washington hid behind the U.N. Security Council to
resist calls for intervention. Mrs. Clinton's department then made the mistake of agreeing to a U.N. arms
embargo on both the Gadhafi regime and the rebels. This blunder forced the rebels to look elsewhere for
weapons and cash, particularly Golf states like Qatar that favored Islamist militias.
As Gadhaffs forces were about to overrun Benghazi in March, the Arab League, Britain and France called for
military intervention. Only after the Security Council gave the green lightâ€”when Russia abstainedâ€”did NATO
launch air strikes. American cruise missiles and *bombers led the way, but on April 7 President Â°barna pulled
the U.S. out of a leadership combat role.
The U.S. also waited until July to recognize the Benghazi rebel opposition as ""the legitimate governing
authority,"" after Luxembourg and 25 other countries had already done so. The war lasted until October, much
longer than necessary.
American disengagement continued after Gadhafi fell. Though rich in oil, Libya's well-intentioned new leaders
needed advice and encouragement to build a functioning state. The most pressing need was to rein in the anti-
Gadhafi militias and stand up a national army. But the U.S. was reluctant to follow up with aid or know-how.
(See our December 24, 2011 editorial, ""MIA on the Shores of Tripoli."") Qatar and the United Arab Emirates
stepped in with money and weapons, again favoring Islamist groups.

This abdication is the backdrop to what happened on September 11. The large CIA outpost in Benghazi was
supposed to monitor jihadists and work with State to round up thousands of mobile surface-to-air missiles in
Libya. Yet it turns out that it's hard to fight terrorists on the ground with drones from remote bases. Without a
functioning government or broader U.S. aid, a small Islamist militia was able to target foreign diplomats and
eventually lay siege to the U.S. compound. The CIA closed its entire Benghazi shop that very morningâ€”an
abject retreat.
For weeks, the Administration has tried to shift blame for Benghazi to the ""intelligence community."" Mr.
Petraeus's fall makes him an easy scapegoat, even as Mrs. Clinton takes a valedictory lap at State and sets her
sights on a 2016 Presidential run.
But U.S. Libya policy has been her handiwork, and with the exception of the fall of Gadhafi it is a notable
failure. Mrs. Clinton is also a main architect of U.S. policy in Syria, which continues to descend into disorder
that may engulf the region. She shouldn't get a free pass from Congress.

Benghazi's Deep Throat fingers Islamist Leaders for
Attacks as State Dept Criticized on Consular Security
Posted on 12/19/2012 by Juan
The report saying that security was inadequate at the compound that the US had adopted as its ad hoc
consulate in 13enghazio Libya dominates today's headlines. That conclusion is obvious. The
""consulate"" was just a private residence taken over for this purpose by the US in the city, It was not
constructed to be a US government building in a potentially hostile city.
I met a person who worked there when I was in Benghazi in June, and she told me that it wasn't even
clear if the consulate would be retained after the first of this year It was possibly temporary,
depending on Congressional funding. (The Tea Party House hasn't been good on meeting requests for
embassy security funds).
The more interesting question than why ad hoc arrangements should have been made for a consulate
during and after the Libyan revolution (the answer to which seems fairly obvious) is, who is
responsible for the string of assassinations and acts of violence in the city, of which the RPG attack on
the consulate on September 11 was only one? Benghazi, with a population of over one million in a
country of 6.5 million, is Libya's second largest city and1/1
e'as the epicenter of the revolution against the
government of Muammar Qaddafi in 2011.
On November 22, Benghazi police chief Farej Darssi was assassinated. In October a police colonel
barely avoided deathâ€” his car was wired to explode, A Libyan intelligence officer was killed in
September. A general was assassinated in August. Some of these figures had worked for Qaddafi but
had defected to the revolution. Qaddafi's security forces were responsible for the 1996 massacre of
hardline fundamentalists at Abu Salim prison, and for making others just disappear, Likely the same
shadowy cells that attacked the US consulate are behind the attacks on Benghazi police and army
officers.
There may have been a break in the case. Last Saturday, Benghazi security forces loyal to the elected
government in Tripoli, captured a man they suspected of being involved with the groups behind the
violence. And, he appears to have been willing to spill the beans. So let's call him the Libyan Deep
Throat.
Deep Throat is so knowledgeable about the conspiracies facing the city and so dangerous to those
hatching them that the latter immediately attempted to spring him from jail.
On Sunday morning, militants attacked the police facility next to the holding cell where the man is
being detained. A policeman at that station died in a hail of bullets from the attackers, and they called
for back-up. The police car that sped to the scene as ambushed and three policemen in it were killed.
Still, the police stood their ground and fought off the assault, and they kept their valuable suspect in
custody, with all his valuable testimony.
Shortly after midnight, on Monday morning, small explosives were set off at the Garyounis police
station in Benghazi, damaging a couple of automobiles but otherwise doing little damage. Then
explosives were set off at al-Uruba police station, which also took sniper fire, but neither resulted in
casualties.

The police became vigilant, and they apprehended a shady-looking man skulking around near the al-
Hadaeg police station, finding him to have two rocket propelled grenades in his possession, which he
was apparently intending to fire at the station.
In other words, the capture of Libyan Deep Throat has set off a gang war on the police, who are being
informed by bombings and shootings that they must let their informant go or risk their
So what is Deep Throat saying? According to local journalist Mohamed Bujenah of the Libyan Herald,
a senior figure in the Benghazi police told him that the informant had fingered as many as 7
prominent Muslim fundamentalist leaders in connection with these attacks, of whom the police
named 6 explicitly:
1 Sufyan Ben Qumu, from the notoriously radical town of Derna, and a former prisoner at
Guantanamo
2.Ahmad Bukatela, leader of the ',Thai& Militia
3.Muhammad al-Zahawi, head of the Ansar al-Sharia militia
4.Muhammad al-Gharabi, a leader of the Rafallala al-Sahati Militia
5.Ismail Sallabi, another leader of Rafallah al-Sahati
6.Salim .Nabous, head of the Zawiya Martyrs' Brigade
It is just a newspaper article. We don't know if the informant actually named these individuals or if he
did so to escape torture, in which case we can't trust what he said. But if the allegations are true, there
is collusion among several hardline militias in the city to create instability in hopes of taking it over.
The new, elected, prime minister Ali Zeidan, has started asserting himself militarily. He closed the
country's southern borders against instability in the Sahel. He may well have some risky house
cleaning to do in Benghazi.

Illhave to defer to Gene on this. It's a fascinating read, and some stuff mentioned has already happened (such as the
appointment ofiuwaili as Minister of Defense Juwaili is close to the UAE, incidentally). But I simply do not know the
ins and outs of the new Libyan politics in sufficient detail to give a view as to the accuracy of this report A few bits
seemed off key (e.g, the reference that both the misrata and Zintan Brigades once reported ""loosely"" to BelHaj I don't
believe is true, since Juwaili and the IJAE supported the latter and Qatar the former).
The comment about Belhaj staying out of govt and thus retain the flexibility to carp and make trouble: Jake, you may
remember that AbZ warned exactly of that danger in that weird mtg Qatar insisted upon on the margins of UNGA.

Another friend of HRC's offers the following assessment/report from a source. HRC interested in your views.
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the highest levels
of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1. During the last week of December 2011, and the first week of 2012, Libya's Prime Minister
Abdurrahim el-Keib and President Mustafa Abdul Jalil engaged in a series of emergency planning meetings
attempting to deal with specific issues threatening the stability of the new National Transitional Council (N'TC)
Government. According to extremely sensitive sources speaking in strict confidence, paramount among these
issues are the questions of disarming and rewarding the regional militias who bore the majority of the fighting
against the regime of Muammar al Qaddafi, as well as the related issue of finding ministers and senior
administrators for the new government who are acceptable to these revolutionary forces. These individuals
noted that on four occasions, beginning on December 23, 2011, groups or angry militiamen came to el-Keib's
office and demanded better treatment, a clear message of support for the role of Islamic law, and the removal
of former Qaddafi advisors from the new government.
2. (Source Comment: In the opinion of a very sensitive source, el-Keib is genuinely concerned that this
situation could spiral out of control and threatens the regime. He also suspects that much of the unrest is being
stirred by General Abdel Hakim Alamin Belhaj and his conservative Islamist supporters. By staying out of the
new government, Belhaj has established a position from which he can criticize their action:3 and appointments
without concern or control. That said, el â€” Keib has been told by his contacts in the Moslem Brotherhood (MB)

that even Belhaj has been surprised that the unrest in the militias has begun to manifest itself in fighting
between groups that previously shared the same goals and operated under BeThais loose command. This is
particularly true in the case of the increasingly violent conflicts between the Misrata and Zintan regional
militias.)
3. In an effort to address these. problems el-Keib is making changes in his new administration, removing
Minister of Economics Taher Sherkaz, who, as a former economic advisor to Qaddafi, was a particular target of
the militiamen. In the opinion of well informed individuals, el-Keib's closest and most influential advisors are
experts with economic backgrounds and experience dealing with Western firms and governments. The most
influential of this group are Minister of Oil Abdulrahman Ben Yezza, Minister of Finance Hassan Ziglam,
National Oil Company chief Nun Bemisien, and Ngeb Obeda from the Libyan Stock Exchange.
4. (Source Comment: In the opinion of a very sensitive source, el-Keib and Jail are also very concerned
over growing criticism that these technocrats are puppets of various Western governments and firms. Belhaj
and the militiamen appear intent on limiting the influence of these Western entities, using them as a weapon to
weaken the el-Keib regime. This trend is also affecting national security, where, despite el-Keib's efforts to
maintain a balance between the Islamists, regional commanders, and the national army, a potentially
dangerous conflict has arisen over the position of Chief of Staff of the National Army. El-Kieb, according to this
individual, believes that he must settle this matter in short order to avoid provoking security concerns among
foreign allies and businesses contacts.)
5. According to a knowledgeable individual, in late December 2011e1-Kieb resisted efforts by General
IChalifa Belqasim Hefter to establish himself as the Chief of Staff of the National Army. Hefter, who lived in the
United States for many years and is believed by Belhaj and others to have a relationship with the U.S.
Government, is using his popularity among the officer corps of the regular NTC army to support his claim to be
Chief of Staff. This produced heated protests from militia leaders and in late December 2011e1-Keib named
deputy Minister of Defense Colonel Yussef al-Mangoush, to be Chief of Staff. In the opinion of one source, this
is a problematic choice, since el-Keib is replacing the supposedly pro-American Hefter with al-Mangoush who
commanded one of Qaddafi's elite Special Forces units, even after the revolution began. This individual
believes that el-Keib's decision was driven by personal animosity toward Hefter, and the influence of Minister
of Defense Osama al-Juwali. The situation is far from resolved, as Hatter and his supporters, particularly in
the Benghazi garrison, continue to claim that the General is the true Chief of Staff. El-Keib and al-Juwali are
working to reconcile all of the elements in this conflict as quickly as possible, before the supporters of the two
claimants begin fighting. In the meantime, el-Keib has stated in private that he fully expects Belhaj to attack
al-Mangoush, but the Prime Minister believes that the Colonel is the only officer strong enough to disarm the
militias and avoid a civil war.
6. At the same time, a very sensitive source added that el-Keib and Jalil are attempting to reconcile the
fighting between Misrata and Zintan forces in Tripoli by naming Misrata leader Fa-wzi Abd Ali as Minister of
the Interior and al-Juwali, who was commander of the Zintan militia, as Minister of Defense. To date,
according to this individual, this effort has met with limited success, as the fighting has continued and the
militias are refusing to disarm until their demands regarding living standards are met.
7. (Source Comment: One very sensitive source noted, that el-Keib is aware of the fact that he is
running out of time to stabilize the situation in Libya. He believes that if he does not disarm the militias and
meet their demands in the next six months there is a good chance of increased fighting among rival groups that
could lead to civil war. In any event, he realizes that the ongoing instability will cause Western governments,
firms, and banks, to hesitate before committing themselves to long term relationships with Libya. El-Keib
believes that Belhaj and his advisors have made the same judgment, and are waiting to fill any vacuum created
by this violence, by establishing a conservative Islamic Republic.)

Subject: RE: HRC friend
jeff thanks for reminding me. The Al-Keeb government is clearly facing many crises, the major one being the inability so
far to implement what appeared to be fairly detailed plans by Minister of Interior Fauzi and Minister of Defense Juwaili to
incorporate 25k thuwar each (total 75k) into the security forces, armed forces and into the private sector (jobs, training,
education). the main obstacles appear to be inability to implement plans by any of the GOL ministers so far and lack of
funds although we hope there will be a solution to that soon. Also, none of the militias appears willing to budge without
seeing some proof that others are also willing to do so.
I am not sure about HRC contact ascribing these problems mainly to Bel-Haj, whose star we believed had fallen over the
past several weeks. The Islamists are demanding their share of the political pie like everyone else-no more and no less. I
met with a Libyan contact yesterday who had just met with an Islamist-led militiaman from Zintan. The leader of this group
demanded that women's role be inscribed in the constitution as per Sharia'-if that did not happen this guy threatened to
take up arms again. Sarkis-the new but now deposed Economy Minister is an example of the power of the street and
different voices clamoring for different things. He was a technocrat whom we dealt with in the past but because of the
perception that he was ""part of the old regime"" he had to go even though al-Keeb regretted the decision since Sarkis was
an able technocrat. So, the bottom line is that the disarming and reintegration of the militias is not going as well as we
would have liked though the Minister of Interior told me on the margins of the PM discussion with DDCI Morrell today that
things on that score were going ""well."" One positive ray of light is that Tripoli Local Council reps told us today that they
had begun registering thuwar to determine which of the three possible categories they couid stream into. Another
disturbing tmed which may be happening is the emergence of organized crime perhaps fueled by old regime elements
including Snussi and al-Baghdadi. According to MOI sources have expressed real concern about an unholy
alliance of former Qadhafi loyalists, criminals who escaped from prison, and odd assortments of different thuwar. They are
apparently getting money, terrorizing the cities by night and engaging in human trafficking, drugs, gunrunning and alcohol
backed by old regime money. The motivation would be economic and political (creating chaos and undermining
stability). Our Legatt reps will meet with the e the Brits tomorrow to see if we can respond to MOI request for help in
training a team to deal with this possible new and troubling phenomenon. Not sure whether this crime phenomenon is
connected to the murder of my good friend Hugo deSamie, a french businessman who had been involved in deals with
the old regime and was back trying his hand with the new group.
It is not clear whether he will survive given the
intense pressure the PM is coming under from the eastern Obeidi tribes-they want one of theirs in the position as
compensation for the murder of Yusuf Obeidi.
So bottom line, there is ferment and things are not progressing as fast and as far as we would like. But let's not panic yet-
the PM is well-intentioned and the ministers are able people if they can get the means to implement their plans. I told the
PM today that we could help in various areas and that we could be as discrete as need be in light of his formidable
political vulnerabilities. By the way, he may be planning to visit Washington and NY end of January-ealry February period.

Another friend of HliC's offers the following assessment/report from a source. HRC interested in your views.
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the highest levels
of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1. During the last is of December 2011, and the first week of 2012, Libya's Prime Minister
Abdurrahim el-Keib and President Mustafa Abdul Jail engaged in a series of emergency planning meetings
attempting to deal with specific issues threatening the stability of the new National Transitional Council (NTC)
Government According to extremely sensitive sources speaking in strict confidence, paramount among these
issues are the questions of disarming and rewarding the regional militias who bore the majority of the fighting
against the regime of Muammar al Qaddafi, as well as the related issue of finding ministers and senior
administrators for the new government who are acceptable to these revolutionary forces. These individuals
noted that on four occasions, beginning on December 23, 2011, groups or angry militiamen came to el-Keib's
office and demanded better treatment, a clear message of support for the role of Islamic law, and the removal
of former Qaddafi advisors from the new government.
2. (Source Comment In the opinion of a very sensitive source, el-Keib is genuinely concerned that this
situation could spiral out of control and threatens the regime. He also suspects that much of the unrest is being
stirred by General Abdel Hakim Alamin Belhaj and his conservative Islamist supporters By staying out of the
new government, Belhaj has established a position from which he can criticize their actions and appointments
without concern or control. That said, el â€” Keib has been told by his contacts in the Moslem Brotherhood (MB)
that even Belhaj has been surprised that the unrest in the militias has begun to manifest itself in fighting
between groups that previously shared the same goals and operated under Belhars loose command. This is
particularly true in the case of the increasingly violent conflicts between the Misrata and Zintan regional
militias.)
3. In an effort to address these problems el-Keib is making changes in his new administration, removing

AP - Rice defends Benghazi remarks
By: Associated Press
November 21, 2012 07:03 PM EST
U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice said Wednesday her early account of the attack that killed the U.S. ambassador to Libya and
three other Americans in Benghazi was based on the initial intelligence community assessments and was always subject
to review and updates.
She said she respected Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who has been critical of her, but said ""some of the statements he's
made about me have been unfounded, but I look forward to having the opportunity at the appropriate time to discuss
all of this with him.""
Her comments attributed the attacks to a mob enraged over an anti-Muslim video posted on YouTube were widely
denounced by Republicans during the U.S. presidential campaign. The attack came an the 11th anniversary of the Sept.
11, 2001, terror attacks on the United States, and her critics said it was clearly a terrorist attack timed to take place on
the anniversary.
The focus has fallen on her because she is a longtime White House insider and is believed to be President Barack
Obama's first choice to replace Secrretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is not expected to stay on during his second term.
Rice told reporters outside the U.N. Security Council: ""As a senior U.S. diplomat, I agreed to a White House request to
appear on the Sunday shows to talk about the full range of national security issues of the day, which at that time were
primarily and particularly the protests that were enveloping and threatening many diplomatic facilities, American
diplomatic facilities around the world, and Iran's nuclear program.""
Hours before the Benghazi violence, a mob in Cairo attacked the U.S. Embassy there to denounce the videos as anti-
Islamic blasphemy. Killed in the Benghazi violence were Ambassador Chris Stevens, foreign service officer Sean Smith
and two former Navy SEALs, Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods.
Rice said, ""The attack on our facilities in Benghazi was obviously a significant piece of this"" pattern.
""When discussing he attack against our facilities in Benghazi, I relied solely and squarely on the information provided to
me by the intelligence community,"" she said.
""I made clear that the information was preliminary, and that our investigations would give us the definitive answers,""
she added.

Statement on the Attack in Benghazi
September 11, 2012
I condemn in the strongest terms the attack on our mission in Benghazi today. As we work to
secure our personnel and facilities, we have confirmed that one of our State Department officers
was killed. We are heartbroken by this terrible loss. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family
and those who have suffered in this attack.
This evening, I called Libyan President Magariaf to coordinate additional support to protect
Americans in Libya. President Magariaf expressed his condemnation and condolences and
pledged his government's full cooperation.
Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted
on the Internet. The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs
of others. Our commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation.
But let me be clear: There is never any justification for violent acts of this kind.
In light of the events of today, the United States government is working with partner countries
around the world to protect our personnel, our missions, and American citizens worldwide.
Statement on the Death of American Personnel in Benghazi, Libya
September 12, 2012
It is with profound sadness that I share the news of the death of four American personnel in
Benghazi, Libya yesterday. Among them were United States Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens
and Foreign Service Information Management Officer, Sean Smith. We are still making next of
kin notifications for the other two individuals. Our hearts go out to all their families and
colleagues.
A 21 year veteran of the Foreign Service, Ambassador Stevens died last night from injuries he
sustained in the attack on our office in Benghazi.
I had the privilege of swearing in Chris for his post in Libya only a few months ago. He spoke
eloquently about his passion for service, for diplomacy and for the Libyan people. This
assignment was only the latest in his more than two decades of dedication to advancing closer
ties with the people of the Middle East and North Africa which began as a Peace Corps
Volunteer in Morocco. As the conflict in Libya unfolded, Chris was one of the first Americans
on the ground in Benghazi. He risked his own life to lend the Libyan people a helping hand to
build the foundation for a new, free nation. He spent every day since helping to finish the work
that he started. Chris was committed to advancing America's values and interests, even when
that meant putting himself in danger.
Sean Smith was a husband and a father of two, who joined the Department ten years ago. Like

Chris, Sean was one of our best. Prior to arriving in Benghazi, he served in Baghdad, Pretoria,
Montreal, and most recently The Hague.
All the Americans we lost in yesterday's attacks made the ultimate sacrifice. We condemn this
vicious and violent attack that took their lives, which they had committed to helping the Libyan
people reach for a better future.
America's diplomats and development experts stand on the front lines every day for our country.
We are honored by the service of each and every one of them.
Remarks on the Deaths of American Personnel in Benghazi, Libya
September 12, 2012
Yesterday, our U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya was attacked. Heavily armed militants
assaulted the compound and set fire to our buildings. American and Libyan security personnel
battled the attackers together. Four Americans were killed. They included Sean Smith, a Foreign
Service information management officer, and our Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens. We are
still making next of kin notifications for the other two individuals.
This is an attack that should shock the conscience of people of all faiths around the world. We
condemn in the strongest terms this senseless act of violence, and we send our prayers to the
families, friends, and colleagues of those we've lost.
All over the world, every day, America's diplomats and development experts risk their lives in
the service of our country and our values, because they believe that the United States must be a
force for peace and progress in the world, that these aspirations are worth striving and sacrificing
for. Alongside our men and women in uniform, they represent the best traditions of a bold and
generous nation.
In the lobby of this building, the State Department, the names of those who have fallen in the line
of duty are inscribed in marble. Our hearts break over each one. And now, because of this
tragedy, we have new heroes to honor and more friends to mourn.
Chris Stevens fell in love with the Middle East as a young Peace Corps volunteer teaching
English in Morocco. He joined the Foreign Service, learned languages, won friends for America
in distant places, and made other people's hopes his own.
In the early days of the Libyan revolution, I asked Chris to be our envoy to the rebel opposition.
He arrived on a cargo ship in the port of Benghazi and began building our relationships with
Libya's revolutionaries. He risked his life to stop a tyrant, then gave his life trying to help build a
better Libya. The world needs more Chris Stevenses. I spoke with his sister, Ann, this morning,
and told her that he will be remembered as a hero by many nations.

Sean Smith was an Air Force veteran. He spent 10 years as an information management officer
in the State Department, he was posted at The Hague, and was in Libya on a brief temporary
assignment. He was a husband to his wife Heather, with whom I spoke this morning. He was a
father to two young children, Samantha and Nathan. They will grow up being proud of the
service their father gave to our country, service that took him from Pretoria to Baghdad, and
finally to Benghazi.
The mission that drew Chris and Sean and their colleagues to Libya is both noble and necessary,
and we and the people of Libya honor their memory by carrying it forward. This is not easy.
Today, many Americans are asking â€” indeed, I asked myselfâ€” how could this happen? How
could this happen in a country we helped liberate, in a city we helped save from destruction?
This question reflects just how complicated and, at times, how confounding the world can be.
But we must be clear-eyed, even in our grief. This was an attack by a small and savage group â€”
not the people or Government of Libya. Everywhere Chris and his team went in Libya, in a
country scarred by war and tyranny, they were hailed as friends and partners. And when the
attack came yesterday, Libyans stood and fought to defend our post. Some were wounded.
Libyans carried Chris' body to the hospital, and they helped rescue and lead other Americans to
safety. And last night, when I spoke with the President of Libya, he strongly condemned the
violence and pledged every effort to protect our people and pursue those responsible.
The friendship between our countries, borne out of shared struggle, will not be another casualty
of this attack. A free and stable Libya is still in America's interest and security, and we will not
turn our back on that, nor will we rest until those responsible for these attacks are found and
brought to justice. We are working closely with the Libyan authorities to move swiftly and
surely. We are also working with partners around the world to safeguard other American
embassies, consulates, and citizens.
There will be more time later to reflect, but today, we have work to do. There is no higher
priority than protecting our men and women wherever they serve. We are working to determine
the precise motivations and methods of those who carried out this assault. Some have sought to
justify this vicious behavior, along with the protest that took place at our Embassy in Cairo
yesterday, as a response to inflammatory material posted on the intemet. America's commitment
to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation. But let me be clear â€” there is
no justification for this, none. Violence like this is no way to honor religion or faith. And as long
as there are those who would take innocent life in the name of God, the world will never know a
true and lasting peace.
It is especially difficult that this happened on September I I th. It's an anniversary that means a
great deal to all Americans. Every year on that day, we are reminded that our work is not yet
finished, that the job of putting an end to violent extremism and building a safe and stable world
continues. But September 11th means even more than that. It is a day on which we remember

thousands of American heroes, the bonds that connect all Americans, wherever we are on this
Earth, and the values that see us through every storm. And now it is a day on which we will

Statement on the Deaths of Tyrone S. Woods and Glen A. Doherty in Benghazi, Libya
September 13, 2012
The attack on our diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya on Tuesday claimed the lives of four
Americans. Yesterday, I spoke about two: Ambassador Chris Stevens and Information
Management Officer Sean Smith. Today, we also recognize the two security personnel who died
helping protect their colleagues. Tyrone S. Woods and Glen A. Doherty were both decorated
military veterans who served our country with honor and distinction. Our thoughts, prayers, and
deepest gratitude are with their families and friends. Our embassies could not carry on our
critical work around the world without the service and sacrifice of brave people like Tyrone and
Glen.
Tyrone's friends and colleagues called him ""Rone,"" and they relied on his courage and skill,
honed over two decades as a Navy SEAL. In uniform, he served multiple tours in Iraq and
Afghanistan. Since 2010, he protected American diplomatic personnel in dangerous posts from
Central America to the Middle East. He had the hands of a healer as well as the arm of a warrior,
earning distinction as a registered nurse and certified paramedic. All our hearts go out to
Tyrone's wife Dorothy and his three sons, Tyrone Jr., Hunter, and Kai, who was born just a few
months ago.
We also grieve for Glen Doherty, called Bub, and his family: his father Bernard, his mother
Barbara, his brother Gregory, and his sister Kathleen. Glen was also a former Navy SEAL and an
experienced paramedic. And he put his life on the line many times, protecting Americans in Iraq,
Afghanistan, and other hotspots. In the end, he died the way he lived â€” with selfless honor and
unstinting valor.
We condemn the attack that took the lives of these heroes in the strongest terms, and we are
taking additional steps to safeguard American embassies, consulates, and citizens around the
world. This violence should shock the conscience of people of all faiths and traditions. We
appreciate the statements of support that have poured in from across the region and beyond.

People of conscience and goodwill everywhere must stand together in these difficult days against
violence, hate, and division.
I am enormously proud of the men and women who risk their lives every day in the service of
our country and our values. They help make the United States the greatest force for peace,
progress, and human dignity that the world has ever known, We honor the memory of our fallen
colleagues by continuing their work and carrying on the best traditions of a bold and generous
nation.
Remarks at the Opening Plenary of the U.S.-Morocco Strategic Dialogue
September 13, 2012
SECRETARY CLINTON: Good morning. Well, let me welcome our friends and colleagues
from Morocco here to the Benjamin Franklin Room on the eighth floor of the State Department
for this very important first session of the U.S.-Morocco Strategic Dialogue. Before I begin to
address the significance of this Strategic Dialogue and the next step in our long relations with
Morocco, I want to say a few words about the events unfolding in the world today.
We are closely watching what is happening in Yemen and elsewhere, and we certainly hope and
expect that there will be steps taken to avoid violence and prevent the escalation of protests into
violence.
I also want to take a moment to address the video circulating on the Internet that has led to these
protests in a number of countries. Let me state very clearly â€” and I hope it is obvious â€” that the
United States Government had absolutely nothing to do with this video. We absolutely reject its
content and message. America's commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very
beginning of our nation. And as you know, we are home to people of all religions, many of
whom came to this country seeking the right to exercise their own religion, including, of course,
millions of Muslims. And we have the greatest respect for people of faith.
To us, to me personally, this video is disgusting and reprehensible. It appears to have a deeply
cynical purpose: to denigrate a great religion and to provoke rage. But as I said yesterday, there
is no justification, none at all, for responding to this video with violence, We condemn the
violence that has resulted in the strongest terms, and we greatly appreciate that many Muslims in
the United States and around the world have spoken out on this issue.
Violence, we believe, has no place in religion and is no way to honor religion. Islam, like other
religions, respects the fundamental dignity of human beings, and it is a violation of that
fundamental dignity to wage attacks on innocents. As long as there are those who are willing to
shed blood and take innocent life in the name of religion, the name of God, the world will never
know a true and lasting peace. It is especially wrong for violence to be directed against
diplomatic missions. These are places whose very purpose is peaceful: to promote better
understuiding across countries and cultures. All governments have a responsibility to protect

those spaces and people, because to attack an embassy is to attack the idea that we can work
together to build understanding and a better future.
Now, I know it is hard for some people to understand why the United States cannot or does not
just prevent these kinds of reprehensible videos from ever seeing the light of day. Now, I would
note that in today's world with today's technologies, that is impossible. But even if it were
possible, our country does have a long tradition of free expression which is enshrined in our
Constitution and our law, and we do not stop individual citizens from expressing their views no
matter how distasteful they may be.
There are, of course, different views around the world about the outer limits of free speech and
free expression, but there should be no debate about the simple proposition that violence in
response to speech is not acceptable. We all â€” whether we are leaders in government, leaders in
civil society or religious leaders â€” must draw the line at violence. And any responsible leader
should be standing up now and drawing that line.
I wanted to begin with this statement, because, as our Moroccan friends and all of you know, this
has been a difficult week at the State Department. I very much appreciate, Minister, the
condolences your government expressed to our Embassy in Rabat And even though that tragedy
happened far away in Benghazi, we found a reminder of the deep bounds that connect Morocco
to the United States. It was in the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco that one of the Americans
we lost this week, Ambassador Chris Stevens, fell in love with the region when he served as a
Peace Corps volunteer there. That experience set him on a decades-long career of service. So in
the memory of fallen friends and colleagues, let us remind ourselves of the many ways in which
riot just our governments but the people of our two nations have worked together to build a better
future.
In many ways, the United States looks to Morocco to be a leader and a model. His Majesty King
Mohammed deserves great credit for the work you've undertaken. In fact, after my visit to Rabat
earlier this year. I told my team: ""We need to start a Strategic Dialogue with Morocco."" No
country has been a friend of the United States longer than Morocco. You were the first nation to
recognize us back in 1777. But we're not satisfied with simply having a friendship that is
longstanding We want one that is dynamic, growing, looking toward the future. So let me
highlight a few of the areas we should focus on today.
On political reform, we have all seen remarkable changes taking place across North Africa and
the Middle East. I commend Morocco and your government for your efforts to stay ahead of
these changes by holding free and fair elections, empowering the elected parliament, taking other
steps to ensure that the government reflects the will of the people. Today, our political working
group will discuss how the United States can continue to support your efforts to translate
commitments into actions. Because as we all know, democracy, real reform, require that people
themselves feel the changes in their evetyday lives: the courts reformed, the government more

open and transparent, universal human rights of all Moroccans â€” men and women alike â€”
respected.
I'm especially pleased by Morocco's commitments to take on the deeply troubling problem of
child marriage. We know that child brides are less likely to get an education, more likely to face
life-threatening problems, particularly around child birth and delivery, which not only
shortchanges them but can even rob them and their communities of their lives and talents. So we
want to encourage the government and civil society to continue their important work together on
this issue.
With regard to the Western Sahara, the United States continues to support efforts to find a
peaceful, sustainable, mutually agreed-upon solution. U.S. policy toward the Western Sahara has
remained consistent for many years. We have made clear that Morocco's autonomy plan is
serious, realistic, and credible, and that it represents a potential approach that could satisfy the
aspirations of the people in the Western Sahara to run their own affairs in peace and dignity. We
continue to support the negotiations carried out by the United Nations and hope parties can work
toward resolution.
With respect to the economy, our second working group will focus on what more can be done to
deliver tangible economic benefits. Morocco's economy is relatively healthy, but you face the
same problem that is now endemic across the world â€” unemployment is still too high, especially
among young people.
That's why the United States is providing $1.5 million to support an effort to attract foreign
investors, foster local economic development, and combat corruption across the region. And I'm
pleased to announce that later this year we will hold a Morocco business development
conference here in Washington to connect businesses from both countries.
Today, we should discuss ways to build on all of these efforts by increasing bilateral trade, a
particular goal of mine since so much trade from Morocco goes to Europe. I'd like to increase
the amount of trade coming to the United States, and also to improve economic integration
across North Africa, which could greatly benefit Morocco because of Morocco's stability and
Morocco's very strong economic foundation. The greater integration there is, the greater the
benefits for Moroccans.
Third, the attack in Benghazi this week reminds us that security remains a vital issue. Through
our work together on the Global Counterterrorism Task Force, the United States and Morocco
already share crucial information and best practices, and I thank Morocco for hosting a Global
Counterterrorism Task Force workshop on threats in the South Atlantic next month.

We are also collaborating through USAID, the Peace Corps, and other agencies to help provide
Moroccan youth with alternatives to criminal and extremist organizations. And so we are
partnering to help strengthen Morocco's criminal justice system and law enforcement.
There will be a lot to discuss in the meeting today. And let me add, the United States greatly
appreciates the constructive role Morocco is playing on the UN Security Council, especially your
support for the effort to end the violence and bloodshed in Syria and help to usher in a new
democratic future for that country. I commend Morocco for offering to host the next ministerial
meeting of the Friends of the Syrian People, and we look forward to continuing to work closely
together as close partners even after your term on the Security Council has ended.
Finally, our education and cultural ties are reason for much celebration. This year marks the 30th
anniversary of our official program to facilitate academic exchanges and other bonds between us.
There are more than 5,000 Moroccan alumni of these programs. Two are with us today â€” Dr.
Benjelloun and Dr. Ouaouicha â€” and we thank them. But among all our work on this front, from
preserving Morocco's historic sites to empowering youth, there's one area I particularly hope we
can focus on today and receive your advice and counsel â€” namely, interfaith dialogue.
In these tense and turbulent times, it's more important than ever for people of different faiths to
exchange ideas, to build understanding, to promote religious tolerance. It's one of the great
challenges of the 21st century, and it's one that we must address together.
So we have a lot of work to do, Minister, but our friendship runs long and deep, and as the treaty
our nations signed in 1786 says, and I quote, ""Trusting in God, it will remain permanent."" I'm
confident that we will continue to solve problems and produce results that make our nations
stronger, more peaceful, more secure, more prosperous, and also contribute to doing the same for
the world.
So again, let me welcome you, Minister. It's been a great pleasure for me to get to know you, to
work with you, to be your colleague bilaterally, regionally, and globally, and also welcome your
distinguished delegation.
Thank you. (Applause.)
Remarks at Reception Ntlarking Eid ul-Fitr

SECRETARY CLINTON: Good evening, and although I am many weeks overdue in saying it:

cherished tradition here at the State Department. And I would like to thank all of you for being

Tonight, our gathering is more somber than any of us would like. This comes during sad and
difficult days for the State Department family. We lost four Americans. They were good and
brave men. They were committed to the cause of building a brighter future for the people of
Libya. And we condemn the violence in the strongest terms, the violence against our posts in
Benghazi, in Egypt, and now in Yemen.
The Libyan ambassador is with us tonight, and I want to take a moment to thank him for the
support that his government and the Libyan people have shown to the United States in this
tragedy, particularly the outpouring of feelings of grief and loss because of the killing of our
ambassador.
Ambassador Aujali, would you mind saying a few words?
AMBASSADOR AMU: [redacted]
SECRETARY CLINTON: Thank you very much, Ambassador. I know that that was a very
personal loss for you, as it was for me. I'm the one who sent Chris to Benghazi during the
revolution to show support and be able to advise our government about what we could do to
bring freedom and democracy and opportunity to the people of Libya.
Religious freedom and religious tolerance are essential to the stability of any nation, any people.
Hatred and violence in the name of religion only poison the well. All people of faith and good
will know that the actions of a small and savage group in Benghazi do not honor religion or God
in any way. Nor do they speak for the more than one billion Muslims around the world, many of
whom have shown an outpouring of support during this time
Unfortunately, however, over the last 24 hours, we have also seen violence spread elsewhere.
Some seek to justify this behavior as a response to inflammatory, despicable material posted on
the intemet. As I said earlier today, the United States rejects both the content and the message of
that video. The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of
others. At our meeting earlier today, my colleague, the foreign minister of Morocco, said that all
prophets should be respected because they are all symbols of our humanity, for all humanity.
But both of us were crystal clear in this paramount message: There is never any justification for
violent acts of this kind. And we look to leaders around the world to stand up and speak out
against violence, and to take steps to protect diplomatic missions from attack.
Think about it. When Christians are subject to insults to their faith, and that certainly happens,
we expect them not to resort to violence. When Hindus or Buddhists are subjected to insults to
their faiths, and that also certainly happens, we expect them not to resort to violence. The same
goes for all faiths, including Islam.

When all of us who are people of faith - and I am one â€” feel the pain of insults, of
misunderstanding, of denigration to what we cherish, we must expect ourselves and others not to
resort to violence, That is a universal standard and expectation, and it is everyone's obligation to
meet that, so that we make no differences, we expect no less of ourselves than we expect of
others, You cannot respond to offensive speech with violence without begetting more violence.
And I so strongly believe that the great religions of the world are stronger than any insults. They
have withstood offense for centuries. Refraining from violence, then, is not a sign of weakness in
one's faith; it is absolutely the opposite, a sign that one's faith is unshakable.
So tonight, we must come together and recommit ourselves to working toward a future marked
by understanding and acceptance rather than distrust, hatred, and fear. We can pledge that
whenever one person speaks out in ignorance and bigotry, ten voices will answer. They will
answer resoundingly against the offense and the insult, answering ignorance with enlightenment,
answering hatred with understanding, answering darkness with light; that if one person commits
a violent act in the name of religion, millions will stand up and condemn it out of strength.
In times like these, it can be easy to despair that some differences are irreconcilable, some
mountains too steep to climb; we will therefore never reach the level of understanding and
peacefulness that we seek, and which I believe the great religions of the world call us to pursue.
But that's not what I believe, and I don't think it's what you believe either here tonight. Part of
what makes our country so special is we keep trying. We keep working. We keep investing in
our future. We keep supporting the next generation, believing that young people can keep us
moving forward in a positive direction.
So tonight I think it's important that we talk not just about that better tomorrow that we all seek,
but also about some of the things â€” the real, practical, tangible things â€” that young people are
doing to help shape that better future.
Two years ago in this room, at our Eid reception, we launched a program called Generation
Change to lead a grassroots agenda of positive engagement with Muslim communities. And I
asked the young Muslim leaders in the audience that night to be our unofficial ambassadors, to
help build personal connections, seek out partners in other countries. And I can report to you
tonight they did not disappoint. In a few minutes, you're going to meet some of these young
leaders, each with a powerful story to tell.
The Generation Change network that started in this room now circles the globe. We are building
an international alliance of young people who want to drive change in their own communities.
They act as mentors, spark respectful debates, simply offer words of encouragement when
needed. But most importantly, they inspire others to keep expanding the circle of mutual
understanding and respect, one person at a time.

Even as we work to spread tolerance more broadly, we also are working to deepen our
appreciation for the experiences of others. Our 2012 Hours Against Hate initiative encourages
young people to put themselves in another person's shoes through service projects. So far, young
people from all over the world have pledged thousands of volunteer hours to help people from a
different background, to see them as a fellow human being, not a stereotype, not a caricature, but
another real live person â€” people who don't look like you, live like you, pray like you, but with
whom we will share this planet. And therefore, we have work to do.
People of faith and conscience are called to be the leaders of tolerance. In my tradition, like all
traditions, we are expected to love one another. And together, we have to translate that into better
understanding and cooperation. I'm particularly pleased that the young people you will hear from
tonight are really setting an example, not only for young people elsewhere in the world but,
frankly, for us who are older as well.
Let me now call to the stage someone who has been a tremendous assistance to me in these
efforts. Farah Pandith is the Department's first Special Representative to Muslim Communities.
And from the beginning, she has made reaching out to young people and civil society her top
priority. Farah will introduce you to three young leaders who I am very proud of

Secretary Panetta, Ambassador Rice, Secretary Powell and Mrs. Powell, family members of the
four patriots and heroes we bring home, members of the State Department family, ladies and

values. To the families of our fallen colleagues, I offer our most heartfelt condolences and
deepest gratitude.
Sean Smith joined the State Department after six years in the Air Force. He was respected as an
expert on technology by colleagues in Pretoria, Baghdad, Montreal, and The Hague. He enrolled
in correspondence courses at Penn State and had high hopes for the future. Sean leaves behind a
loving wife Heather, two young children, Samantha and Nathan, and scores of grieving family,
friends, and colleagues. And that's just in this world. Because online in the virtual worlds that
Sean helped create, he is also being mourned by countless competitors, collaborators, and garners
who shared his passion.

Glen Doherty, who went by Bub, was also a former SEAL and an experienced paramedic. He too
died as he lived, serving his country and protecting his colleagues. Glen deployed to some of the
most dangerous places on Earth, including Iraq and Afghanistan, always putting his life on the
line to safeguard other Americans. Our thoughts and prayers are with Glen's father Bernard, his
mother Barbara, his brother Gregory, his sister Kathleen, and their grieving families, friends, and
colleagues.
I was honored to know Ambassador Chris Stevens. I want to thank his parents and siblings, who
are here today, for sharing Chris with us and with our country. What a wonderful gift you gave
us. Over his distinguished career in the Foreign Service, Chris won friends for the United States
in far-flung places. He made those people's hopes his own. During the revolution in Libya, he
risked his life to help protect the Libyan people from a tyrant, and he gave his life helping them
build a better country.
People loved to work with Chris. And as he rose through the ranks, they loved to work for Chris.
He was known not only for his courage but for his smile â€” goofy but contagious â€” for his sense
of fun and that California cool.
In the days since the attack, so many Libyans â€” including the Ambassador from Libya to the
United States, who is with us today â€” have expressed their sorrow and solidarity. One young
woman, her head covered and her eyes haunted with sadness, held up a handwritten sign that said
""Thugs and killers don't represent Benghazi nor Islam,"" The President of the Palestinian
Authority, who worked closely with Chris when he served in Jerusalem, sent me a letter
remembering his energy and integrity, and deploring â€” and I quote â€” ""an act of ugly terror.""
Many others from across the Middle East and North Africa have offered similar sentiments.
This has been a difficult week for the State Department and for our country. We've seen the
heavy assault on our post in Benghazi that took the lives of those brave men. We've seen rage
and violence directed at American embassies over an awful interne video that we had nothing to
do with. It is hard for the American people to make sense of that because it is senseless, and it is
totally unacceptable.
The people of Egypt, Libya, Yemen, and Tunisia did not trade the tyranny of a dictator for the
tyranny of a mob. Reasonable people and responsible leaders in these countries need to do
everything they can to restore security and hold accountable those behind these violent acts. And
we will, under the President's leadership, keep taking steps to protect our personnel around the
world.
There will be more difficult days ahead, but it is important that we don't lose sight of the
fundamental fact that America must keep leading the world. We owe it to those four men to
continue the long, hard work of diplomacy. I am enormously proud of the men and women of the
State Department. I'm proud of all those across our government, civilian and military alike, who

represent America abroad. They help make the United States the greatest force for peace,
progress, and human dignity the world has ever known. If the last few days teach us anything, let
it be this: That this work and the men and women who risk their lives to do it are at the heart of
what makes America great and good.
So we will wipe away our tears, stiffen our spines, and face the future undaunted. And we will
do it together, protecting and helping one another, just like Sean, Tyrone, Glen, and Chris always
did. May God bless them and grant their families peace and solace, and may God continue to
bless the United States of America.
And now, let me have the great honor of introducing someone who came to the State Department
earlier this week to grieve with us. He well understands and values the work that these men were
doing for our country. The President of the United States.
Remarks With Mexican Secretary of Foreign Relations Patricia Espinosa After Their
Meeting
September 18, 2012
SECRETARY CLINTON: Good afternoon, everyone. And it is such a pleasure for me to
welcome my friend and colleague, Secretary Espinosa, along with a very distinguished
delegation of officials from the Mexican Government for this continuation of consultation at the
highest levels of each of our governments.
Before I turn to the matters discussed today, let me give a brief update on the ongoing U.S.
response to the protests in the Middle East and elsewhere. I'm sure as you know already, we are
taking aggressive steps to protect our staffs in embassies and consulates worldwide. That
includes reviewing our security posture at every post and augmenting it where necessary. And
we are working closely with the Libyan Government in our efforts to bring to justice those who
murdered our four American colleagues in Benghazi.
The FBI is now in Tripoli to join the investigation with Libyan officials, and there is nothing
more important to us than ensuring the safety of our American representatives worldwide. At the
same time, as I have said to State Department employees, the incidents of the past week highlight
how important our work is. The United States must and will remain strongly engaged in the
world. Our men and women risk their lives in service to our country and our values, because they
know that the United States must be a force for peace and progress. That is worth striving and
sacrificing for, and nothing that happened last week changes this fundamental fact.
Now, turning to our friends and partners in Mexico, we are always pleased to have a chance to
discuss matters of mutual interest and concern between us. Mexico is one of our closest friends
as well as partner on dozens of critical issues. So we talk about every kind of issue you can
imagine, from education and healthcare to poverty alleviation to the environment. But today, we
focused on a top priority for us both a security.

We just co-chaired the fourth meeting of the U.S.-Mexico Merida High-Level Consultative
Group. This is the last one we will hold during the Calderon Administration. And I want to offer
my personal appreciation to President Calderon and to Foreign Secretary Espinosa for their
leadership and commitment to this partnership and to all on both sides of the border in our
governments who have been deeply engaged and committed to it. The Merida Initiative
represents an unprecedented level of security cooperation between Mexico and the United States.
As our countries continue to deal with the serious challenge of transnational criminal
organizations, including drug traffickers, illegal arms traffickers, money launderers, and violent
gangs that threaten people on both sides of the border, we well know there is no quick and easy
way to stop these criminals and bring them to justice. But nevertheless, during the past now
nearly four years, our countries have collaborated to an extraordinary and unprecedented degree.
We have brought together policy makers and experts from across our governments and societies
who have worked hand in hand to keep our people safe. And I think the habits of cooperation we
have built are among our most important achievements, and we will rely on them for a long time
to come.
Today, our delegations reviewed the gains we've made on key priorities, including improving
law enforcement coordination, reducing the demand for drugs, modernizing our border
infrastructure, strengthening the rule of law, and building more resilient and empowered
communities. We also discussed the lessons we've learned and the work that lies ahead in these
and other areas, which our joint statement will reflect. I want to underscore how important our
security relationship with Mexico is to the United States.
The Government of Mexico and the Mexican people have faced the threat posed by these
criminals with courage and resolve, and we remain committed to doing everything we can to
support Mexico as it continues to work to bring those criminals to justice. This is a transnational
problem, and it calls for a transnational solution, and the United States believes this is a matter of
shared responsibility. That was the first message I brought as Secretary of State when I came to
Mexico, and it continues to be the hallmark of our efforts together. Making sure our people are
safe and our neighbors are safe is of the utmost importance to us.
Now, our two countries share many other priorities, and one of them, empowering women and
girls, was also addressed today. We took the opportunity, the Foreign Secretary and I, to sign a
Memorandum of Understanding between our countries to work together to advance gender
equality, empower girls and women, promote their human rights, and enhance their security.
So again, Secretary Espinosa, let me thank you for years of work and effort, for our productive
conversations in many places around the world and again today, and for being such a valuable
colleague and partner. The United States deeply, deeply values our relationship with Mexico and
the ties of family and friendship that connect so many millions of our people.

And we look forward to the future. We believe strongly that presidential administrations may
change, elections will come and go, but we have established a firm foundation for cooperation
that has already benefited both our countries and which will continue to benefit both of our
countries for many years ahead. So thank you very much.
MS. NULAND: We'll take (inaudible). Margaret Brennan, CBS News.
QUESTION: Madam Secretary, thanks for your time. Are you any closer to finding who killed
Ambassador Chris Stevens?, Libya's President says this attack was planned for months. Are you
confident he's wrong and that security measures were appropriate? And will you leave justice to
the Libyans?
SECRETARY CLINTON: As I said at the outset, we are taking aggressive steps to protect our
people and our consulates and embassies around the world. We are reviewing our security
posture at every post and working with host governments to be sure they know what our security-
needs are wherever necessary. We are also working closely with the Libyan Government to bring
the perpetrators to justice so that we can be assured that we have found who murdered our four,
colleagues and under what circumstances. As I said, the FBI has joined the investigation inside
Libya, and we will not rest until the people who orchestrated this attack are found and punished.
It is also important to look at this strategically and understand what is going on across the region.
In a number of places where protests have tuned violent, we are seeing the hand of extremists
who are trying to exploit people's inflamed passions for their own agendas. But overwhelmingly,
we have found that the people of Egypt, of Libya, of Yemen and Tunisia are not prepared to
trade the tyranny of a dictator for the tyranny of a mob. They want to turn their attention to the
future to provide better opportunities for themselves and their children, and they want a strong
partnership with the United States and the American people based on mutual interests and mutual
respect.
This is part of a larger debate that is going on inside these societies. In Libya, for example, in
their first free elections, moderates were successful at the polls. But look, there are extremists in
all of these societies and on the outside who are working to take advantage of broad outrage in
order to incite violence and specifically incite violence against Americans and American
facilities.
And as I have said to many of the leaders I have spoken to over the past week, these extremist
efforts are a threat to the people of the societies and the governments of those societies as well as
to the region and the United States. And I think it's important at this moment for leaders to put
themselves on the right side of this debate - to speak out clearly and unequivocally against
violence, whoever incites it or conducts it
And in a struggle like this, there can be no doubt where the United States must stand. We support
those who are fighting for the same values and rights that we believe in - in democracy, in

freedom, in universal rights for men and women, for justice and accountability. And I want to
underscore that the United States will continue to work with partners and allies in the region and
around the world to help bring security to these nations so that the promise of the revolutions that
they experienced can be realized.
And finally, on your specific point about Benghazi, we obviously never talk publicly about
security at any of our missions for obvious reasons. But that said, let me assure you that our
security in Benghazi included a unit of host government security forces, as well as a local guard
force of the kind that we rely on in many places around the world. In addition to the security
outside the compound, we relied on a wall and a robust security presence inside the compound.
And with all of our missions overseas, in advance of September lid', as is done every year, we
did an evaluation on threat streams. And the Office of the Director of National Intelligence has
said we had no actionable intelligence that an attack on our post in Benghazi was planned or
imminent.
But let me state the obvious again. Our diplomats engage in dangerous work, and it's the nature
of diplomacy in fragile societies and conflict zones to be aware of the necessity for security but
to also continue the important diplomatic work that has to go on. There is risk inherent in what
we do and what these brave men and women representing the United States are up against every
single day, and we do our very best to limit that risk by ensuring that our security protocols
reflect the environments in which diplomats work and the threats that they are presented with.
Thank you.
Remarks With Indonesian Foreign Minister Raden Mohammad Marty Muliana
Natalegawa After Their Meeting
September 20, 2012
SECRETARY CLINTON: Good afternoon, everyone. And it's such a pleasure, as always, to
welcome the Indonesian Foreign Minister, and I believe the largest delegation that has ever come
from Indonesia, for the purpose of our third meeting of the U.S.-Indonesia Joint Commission.
This commission is the result of a vision by our two presidents for a comprehensive partnership,
and the agreement to that effect was signed in 2010. Thanks to this partnership, the United States
and Indonesia are working more closely than ever on a range of issues from global security to
clean energy and climate to regional trade and commerce.
And today, Marty and I had the chance to take stock of where our teams have come in the time
of the last year, because we liad our meeting in Bali a year ago. And I must say, I was very
impressed. We covered a great deal today.

But before I start, I'd like to say a few words about the protests in several countries around the
world. We have condemned in the strongest possible terms the violence that has erupted from
these protests. And as I have said, the video that sparked these protests is disgusting and
reprehensible, and the United States Government, of course, had absolutely nothing to do with it.
But there is no justification for violence, and I want to thank the Foreign Minister and his
government for speaking out against violence. We have to look to reasonable people and
responsible leaders everywhere to stand up to extremists who would seek to take advantage of
this moment to commit violent acts against embassies and their fellow countrymen.
Today's meetings have highlighted the strong foundation that we have built together. And one of
our most important concerns is promoting peace and stability in the Asia Pacific. Today, I'm
announcing that the Obama Administration has informed Congress of the potential sale of eight
AH-64D Apache Longbow helicopters to the Indonesian Government. This agreement will
strengthen our comprehensive partnership and help enhance security across the region.
On growth and prosperity, we are increasing our trade relationship that topped $26 billion last
year. Investments in transportation, energy, and infrastructure are creating jobs and supporting
economic growth in both countries. For example, the deal between Lion Air and Boeing alone
represents $21 billion in trade over the next decade. Indonesia's Government has announced half
a trillion dollars in infrastructure improvements, and we recently signed a memorandum of
understanding to make it easier for American companies to bid on these projects.
And yesterday, we signed an agreement for implementing our Millennium Challenge
Corporation Compact with Indonesia. Over the next five years, the United States will invest $600
million in clean energy development, child health and nutrition programs, and efforts to help
make Indonesia's Government more transparent and open.
The United States is also looking forward to Indonesia hosting APEC in 2013, and we are
confident that Indonesia will come to this role with a commitment to promote greater economic
integration across the Asia Pacific.
Both the Foreign Minister and I believe that strong education is essential to compete in a modem
global economy. That's why the United States has expanded the Fulbright Program and
supported partnerships between dozens of American and Indonesian universities. Academic
exchanges between our countries are up and applications from Indonesian students to visit the
United States have increased by one third. USAID has recently expanded its basic education
program to provide $83 million for teacher training and literacy programs for young children.
And we're providing $20 in scholarship funding for Indonesian graduate students.

I also thanked the Minister for Indonesia's leadership in ASEAN. The Foreign Minister's
personal leadership has helped lay the groundwork for diplomacy between ASEAN and China as
it relates to the South China Sea. And we continue to support ASEAN's six-point principles,
which we believe will help reduce tensions and pave the way for a comprehensive code of
conduct for addressing disputes without threats, coercion, or use of force.
Finally. Indonesia and the United States have stood together on a range of global challenges,
from democratic reform in Burma to combating climate change, to working to end the violence
in Syria. We are also coordinating efforts to further develop south-south and triangular
cooperation, such as enhancing disaster preparedness in Burma and convening a conference on
women's empowerment.
We believe that as the second and third-largest democracies in the world, the United States and
Indonesia have a special responsibility to promote democracy and human rights. And for the last
four years, Indonesia has hosted the Bali Democracy Forum to promote peaceful, democratic
transitions through example and open dialogue. Last year, more than 80 countries attended. And
once again, the United States will be sending a high-level delegation.
So, Minister, thank you for everything. Thank you for the great partnership we've had between
us and between our countries.
MS. NULAND: We'll take two questions today, we'll start with Ros Jordan of Al Jazeera
English.
QUESTION: Thank you, Madam Secretary, Mr. Foreign Minister. Madam Secretary, my
question is about the ongoing investigation into last week's attack at the consulate in Benghazi.
You are meeting this afternoon with members of Congress to discuss the progress and the
concerns that they understandably have. First, there is the federal mandate to establish an
accountability review board. Have you done so? Who would you like to see chair it? Are there
certain questions that you desperately want to have answered in order to safeguard the safety of
Foreign Service Officers around the world?
And related to this, given the political instability and the successes of the past year and a half, are
you satisfied that in light of those political changes, enough was done to protect those working in
the Middle East and North Africa? And then finally â€” and this is perhaps going into the area of
rumor and speculation â€” but there is at least one report suggesting that Ambassador Stevens felt
that he was on a, quote, ""al-Qaida hit list"" Is this a scurrilous rumor? Is this gallows humor
when one is working in a period of difficulty and great challenge, or is there something more to
what he allegedly â€” and I stress that word â€” said?

SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, first, let me say I'm looking forward to the opportunity to go
up to the Congress today. I will be briefing in two separate sessions, the House and the Senate, in
a classified setting, along with my interagency colleagues, as we continue to work together, and
with governments around the world, to ensure that our people and our facilities are safe. I will be
joined today by the Director of National Intelligence, General Clapper, by the Deputy Secretary
of Defense, Ash Carter, by the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Sandy Winnefeld,
along with experts from the FBI, the State Department, and elsewhere in the government.
Now, I anticipate that this briefing will cover our security posture before and during the events,
and the steps we have taken since to do everything we can with host governments to protect our
people and our embassies and consulates. The Director of National Intelligence will speak to the
intelligence issues surrounding these events in Libya. Deputy Secretary Carter will brief on the
superb support we have had from the U.S. military in the wake of these events, and we are at the
very early stages of an FBI investigation. The team from the FBI reached Libya earlier this week.
And I will advise Congress also that I am launching an accountability review board that will be
chaired by Ambassador Thomas Pickering.
I will also talk about the importance of the broader relationships with these countries in light of
the events of the past days. There are obviously very real challenges in these new democracies,
these fragile societies, but as I said last week, the vast majority of the people in these countries
did not throw off the tyranny of a dictator to trade it for the tyranny of a mob. And we are
concerned first and foremost with our own people and facilities, but we are concerned about the
internal security in these countries because ultimately, that puts at risk the men, women, and
children of these societies on a daily ongoing basis if actions are not taken to try to restore
security and civil order.
And let me just conclude by saying that there can be no doubt where the United States stands.
We continue to support those who are fighting for universal values â€” values that we see at work
in Indonesia â€” the third largest democracy in the world. We believe that these values of universal
rights, of justice and accountability, of democracy, are there for every person regardless of where
that person might live. So I will look forward to having a chance to talk with members of
Congress.
As to your final question, I have absolutely no information or reason to believe that there's any
basis for that.
QUESTION: Thank you.
MS. NULAND: Last question. Victoria Sidjabat from Tempo Magazine, please.

designed as a weapon to attack U.S. by raising sentiment anti-U.S. from the countries which has
Muslim majority population like Indonesia.
Madam Clinton, how do you see this threat as on the long run? If it's continuing happen, it's â€”
obviously could give impact to the implementation of (inaudible) program in Indonesia. What is
the reason U.S. Government closed the Embassy and Consulate in Indonesia? What is your
expectation from Indonesia Government, for my Minister Marty Natalegawa? How Indonesia
Government respond to the closing of this Embassy and Consulate, it's starting today? Is U.S. â€”
Indonesia Government has capability to protect U.S. Embassy and Consulate. So the (inaudible)
program implemented â€” could be implemented successfully in Indonesia. Thank you.
SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, let me begin by saying how grateful we are for the excellent
cooperation we have received from the Government of Indonesia, and in particular, from the law
enforcement and security institutions in Indonesia. We are very grateful for not only the
cooperation and protection that has been provided to our facilities, but also to the strong
statements condemning violence from the President, the Foreign Mihister, and others.
In consultation with the Government of Indonesia, we have temporarily, for tomorrow, closed
our facilities. We want to be sure that law enforcement in Indonesia has the ability to do what it
needs to do to make sure that there is no disruption of civil order and security. So we are
cooperating completely, and we're very grateful for the strong leadership provided by Indonesia.
FOREIGN MINISTER NATALEGAWA: Hello, (inaudible), if I may just also respond.
Precisely as the Secretary had said, the decision by the United States Government to close
temporarily its embassies and consulates tomorrow in Indonesia is a decision that's been made
based on communication and conversation between the authorities in Indonesia and the United
States as well. So in other words, it is an informed decision, a decision that is not intended to
show any unfriendly intent on the part of anyone, but it is what it is, and it's quite some â€” it's the
kind of step that governments actually carry out when situations requires it, even in our case.
Some of our embassies abroad, when the situation requires us to have a temporary closing of the
embassy, we do that as well. So it is something that is quite regular and something that is
actually coordinated as well.
But if I may just broaden the subject matter, I think as our President had said in the past,
Indonesian Government the Indonesian people, even, obviously cannot and would not condone
the â€” any acts of violence against diplomatic premises, against diplomatic personnel, because
that is, truly â€” would be a challenge to the efficient and a proper conduct of relations among
states. So that's our point of departure.
At the same time, of course, beyond the immediate issue of protection of the embassies, we have
still ahead of us the challenge of how to prevent the kind of situations where we are now at in

terms of the kind of incendiary and the kind of statements or, in this instance, films that cause â€”
that is now we have all deplored and condemned for these kind of activities not to be repeated.
So we have a lot of homework to work towards in the future as well.

Remarks With Pakistani Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar Before Their Meeting
September 21, 2012
Good afternoon, and let me begin by welcoming Foreign Minister Khar on her first visit to
Washington as foreign minister. We've had the opportunity to meet in Islamabad and other
settings, but I am very pleased that we would have this chance to exchange views on our bilateral
relationship as well as regional and global issues.
I want to begin by addressing the events of the day and the past week. Today, we've once again
seen protests in several cities in Pakistan. Unfortunately, some of those protests have turned
violent and, sadly, resulted in loss of life. I want to thank the Government of Pakistan for their
efforts to protect our Embassy in Islamabad and consulates in Lahore, Peshawar, and Karachi.
And I want to be clear, as I have said on numerous occasions, the violence we have seen cannot
be tolerated. There is no justification for violence. Of course, there is provocation, and we have
certainly made clear that we do not in any way support provocation. We found the video that's at
the core of this series of events offensive, disgusting, reprehensible.
But that does not provide justification for violence, and therefore it is important for responsible
leaders, indeed responsible people everywhere, to stand up and speak out against violence and
particularly against those who would exploit this difficult moment to advance their own
extremist ideologies.
Yesterday afternoon when I briefed the Congress, I made it clear that keeping our people
everywhere in the world safe is our top priority. What happened in Benghazi was a terrorist
attack, and we will not rest until we have tracked down and brought to justice the terrorists who
murdered four Americans. And we are taking aggressive measures at all of our posts to protect
our staffs and their families along with locally employed people who provide so many important
contributions to the work of our missions.
The Foreign Minister and I will have a chance to cover a full range of subjects today, and it is no
secret that the past year and a half has been challenging for Pakistan and the United States. And
we still have work to do to get our bilateral relationship to the point where we would like it to be,
but we both recognize that we can achieve more when we work together on a focused agenda. So

today is the latest in a series of high-level meetings. Ambassador Marc Grossman has just
returned from consultations in Islamabad. I look forward to seeing President Zardari next week
at the UN General Assembly. At each meeting, we are working to identify the strategic goals we
share â€” and there are many â€” and the concrete actions we can each take to accomplish them.
Our number one shared priority remains pursuing our joint counterterrorism objectives to ensure
the security of American and Pakistani citizens alike. We face a common threat from a common
enemy, and we must confront terrorism and extremism together. Earlier this month, I designated
the Haqqani Network as a Foreign Terrorist Organization so we could make full use of every
available legal authority to end their deadly attacks. Pakistan's parliament has called for
expelling foreign fighters so that Pakistan's territory can be fully under control of the Pakistani
Government and cannot be used to launch attacks against other nations.
And the follow-through on this is challenging but necessary, and we look forward to working
with Pakistan as they continue to address these problems. We have both pledged to support a
secure, stable, and prosperous Afghanistan, which is vital for the security of the region. And I
want to thank Foreign Minister Khar for Pakistan's reopening of the NATO supply lines to allow
the movement of goods to Afghanistan.
We will discuss the successful first meeting of the Safe Passage Working Group in Islamabad
which brought together Afghan, Pakistani, and U.S. representatives to advance the peace process
in Afghanistan. The Pakistani Government's public call for insurgents to come forward and talk
with the Afghan Government was particularly important. We are ready to work together to build
on these steps, and we will continue our discussions through bilateral consultations and the U.S.-
Afghanistan-Pakistan Core Group.
Now, of course, our relationship goes far beyond our shared security concerns, and today we will
discuss the many other ways in which we work together, particularly to create economic
opportunity for Pakistanis. Foreign Minister Khar and I agree that we need to shift our economic
relationship from aid to trade and investment. We are working to help Pakistan attract more
private sector investment. We hope to finalize a bilateral investment treaty soon. And we've
created a Pakistan private investment initiative to help more of Pakistan's small and medium
sized companies get access to capital.
Over the past few years, we have seen Pakistan's civilian government begin to put down stronger
roots. And if elections proceed as planned next year, it will mark the first time in Pakistan's
history that a civilian-led government has served its full term. The United States supports
Pakistan's economic development, and we have said many times that we want to see democracy
succeed in Pakistan.

We also support Pakistan's sovereignty, but we are clear that all sovereign nations carry certain
obligations to protect the human rights of their citizens, to control their territory, to prevent
threats to their neighbors and the international community.
So we know that there is still much to be done, but I can assure the people of Pakistan that the
United States remains committed to this important relationship and we are confident we can
continue to move forward together one step at a time to reach our shared strategic objectives.
Thank you very much.
Remarks With Tunisian Foreign Minister Rank Abdessalem Before Their Meeting
September 21, 2012
SECRETARY CLINTON: Good morning. I am pleased to welcome the Foreign Minister from
Tunisia I'm looking forward to our meeting, We obviously have a great deal to discuss, and I
want to thank the Foreign Minister and the Government of Tunisia for their efforts over the last
week to help secure our Embassy and the American Cooperative School of Tunis following the
violent assaults of last Friday.
We are monitoring events closely today. There is no higher priority for President Obama and
myself than the safety of our people. We've taken a number of steps around the world to
augment security and to protect our personnel at diplomatic posts. And we are working closely
with host governments in this effort.
As I have said before and as is embodied in the Vienna Convention and other international
agreements, all governments have the duty, the solemn duty, to defend diplomatic missions.
They must be safe and protected places so that governments can exchange views and work on
many important issues, and leaders across the world must stand up and be counted in rejecting
violence and holding violent actors accountable.
We are working closely with the Government of Tunisia They have assisted us in enhancing the
security of our facilities. We've also discussed with them the imperative of bringing to justice
those responsible for these violent attacks. And we have offered and will continue to look for
ways that we can assist the new Government of Tunisia in ensuring the rule of law throughout
their country, first and foremost for the people of Tunisia themselves. We look forward to
continuing to build our hew partnership with the Tunisian Government and people. Our
relationship is built around the shared principles of all democracies â€” a commitment to
nonviolence, to tolerance, and inclusivity for all people, and to upholding the rule of law.
The Tunisian people have bravely put themselves on the road to democracy. They were the first
of the Arab revolutions and they have made important progress in a very short period of time.
They have worked too hard and sacrificed too much over too many years to see their progress
hijacked at derailed by extremists with Ulric own a5,-.

Tunisia but in too many places around the world, look for opportunities to exploit this current
situation or other situations, and all people and leaders must stand against them.
So as the Tunisian Government takes steps to strengthen security and protect the Tunisian people
and economy from extremism and violent agendas, the United States stands ready to help. We
also are working closely with Tunisia on the broader shared threat of terrorism, including from
groups like al-Qaida and its affiliates.
So Minister, please know the United States remains committed to supporting Tunisia as you deal
with this current situation, as you continue your democratic transition, and we want to be with
you as you confront challenges and help seize opportunities together for the betterment of the
future of Tunisia.

Subject: RE: HRC friend
jeff thanks for reminding me. The Al-Keeb government is clearly facing many crises, the major one being the inability so
far to implement what appeared to be fairly detailed plans by Minister of Interior Fauzi and Minister of Defense Juwaili to
incorporate 25k thuwar each (total 75k) into the security forces, armed forces and into the private sector (jobs, training,
education). the main obstacles appear to be inability to implement plans by any of the GOL ministers so far and lack of
funds although we hope there will be a solution to that soon. Also, none of the militias appears willing to budge without
seeing some proof that others are also willing to do so.
I am not sure about HRC contact ascribing these problems mainly to Bel-Haj, whose star we believed had fallen over the
past several weeks. The Islamists are demanding their share of the political pie like everyone else-no more and no less. I
met with a Libyan contact yesterday who had just met with an Islamist-led militiaman from Zintan. The leader of this group
demanded that women's role be inscribed in the constitution as per Sharia'-if that did not happen this guy threatened to
take up arms again. Sarkis-the new but now deposed Economy Minister is an example of the power of the street and
different voices clamoring for different things. He was a technocrat whom we dealt with in the past but because of the
perception that he was ""part of the old regime"" he had to go even though al-Keeb regretted the decision since Sarkis was
an able technocrat. So, the bottom line is that the disarming and reintegration of the militias is not going as well as we
would have liked though the Minister of Interior told me on the margins of the PM discussion with DDCI Morrell today that
things on that score were going ""well."" One positive ray of light is that Tripoli Local Council reps told us today that they
had begun registering thuwar to determine which of the three possible categories they could stream into. Another
disturbing trned which may be happening is the emergence of organized crime perhaps fueled by old regime elements
including Snussi and al-Baghdadi. According to MOI sources have expressed real concern about an unholy
alliance of former Qadhafi loyalists, criminals who escaped from prison, and odd assortments of different thuwar. They are
apparently getting money, terrorizing the cities by night and engaging in human trafficking, drugs, gunrunning and alcohol
backed by old regime money. The motivation would be economic and political (creating chaos and undermining
stability). Our Legatt reps will meet with the e the Brits tomorrow to see if we can respond to MOI request for help in
training a team to deal with this possible new and troubling phenomenon. Not sure whether this crime phenomenon is
connected to the murder of my good friend Hugo deSamie, a french businessman who had been involved in deals with
the old regime and was back trying his hand with the new group.
It is not clear whether he will survive given the
intense pressure the PM is coming under from the eastern Obeidi tribes-they want one of theirs in the position as
compensation for the murder of Yusuf Obeidi.

So bottom line, there is ferment and things are not progressing as fast and as far as we would like. But let's not panic yet-
the PM is well-intentioned and the ministers are able people if they can get the means to implement their plans. Itold the
PM today that we could help in various areas and that we could be as discrete as need be in light of his formidable
political vulnerabilities. By the way, he may be planning to visit Washington and NY end of January-ealry February period.

Another friend of 1-111Cs offers the following assessment/report from a source. HRC interested in your views.
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the highest levels
of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1.During the last week of December 2011, and the first week of2012, Libya'sPrime Minister
Abdurrahim el-Keib and President Mustafa Abdul Jai engaged in a series of emergency planning meetings
attempting to deal with specific issues threatening the stability of the new National Transitional Council (NTC)
Government. According to extremely sensitive sources speaking in strict confidence, paramount among these
issues are the questions of disarming and rewarding the regional militias who bore the majority of the fighting
against the regime of Muammar al Qaddafi, as well as the related issue of finding ministers and senior
administrators for the new government who are acceptable to these revolutionary forces. These individuals
noted that on four occasions, beginning on December 23, 2011, groups or angry militiamen came to el-Keib's
office and demanded better treatment, a clear message of support for the role of Islamic law, and the removal
of former Qaddafi advisors from the new government.
2. (Source Comment: In the opinion of a very sensitive source, el-Keib is genuinely concerned that this
situation could spiral out of control and threatens the regime. He also suspects that much of the unrest is being
stirred by General Abdel Hakim Alamin Belhaj and his conservative Islamist supporters. By staying out of the
new government, Belhaj has established a position from which he can criticize their actions and appointments
without concern or control. That said, el â€” Keib has been told by his contacts in the Moslem Brotherhood (MB)
that even Belhaj has been surprised that the unrest in the militias has begun to manifest itself in fighting
between groups that previously shared the same goals and operated under Belhaj's loose command. This is
particularly true in the case of the increasingly violent conflicts between the Misrata and Zintan regional
militias.)
3. Inan effort to address these problems el-Keib is making changes in his new administration, removing
Minister of Economics Taher Sherkaz, who, as a former economic advisor to Qaddafi, was a particular target of
the militiamen. In the opinion of well informed individuals, el-Keib's closest and most influential advisors are
experts with economic backgrounds and experience dealing with Western firms and governments. The most
influential of this group are Minister of Oil Abdulrahman Ben Yezza, Minister of Finance Hassan Ziglam,
National Oil Company chief Nuni Berrusien, and Ngteb Obeda from the Libyan Stock Exchange.
4. (Source Comment: In the opinion of a very sensitive source, el-Keib and Jalil are also very concerned
over growing criticism that these technocrats are puppets of various Western governments and firms. Belhaj

and the militiamen appear intent on limiting the influence of these Western entities, using them as a weapon to
weaken the el-Keib regime. This trend is also affecting national security, where, despite el-Keila's efforts to
maintain a balance between the Islamists, regional commanders, and the national army, a potentially
dangerous conflict has arisen over the position of Chief of Staff of the National Army. El-Kieb, according to this
individual, believes that he must settle this matter in short order to avoid provoking security concerns among
foreign allies and businesses contacts.)
5. According to a knowledgeable individual, in late December aotiel-Kieb resisted efforts by General
Khalifa Belgasint Hefter to establish himself as the Chief of Staff of the National Army. Hefter, who lived in the
United States for manyyears and is believed by Belhaj and others to have a relationship with the U.S.
Government, is using his popularity among the officer corps of the regular NTC army to support his claim to be
Chief of Staff. This produced heated protests from militia leaders and in late December 2011e1-Keib named
deputy Minister of Defense Colonel Yussef al-Mangoush, to be Chief of Staff. In the opinion of one source, this
is a problematic choice, since el-Keib is replacing the supposedly pro-American Haftar with al-Mangoush who
commanded one of Qaddafi's elite Special Forces units, even after the revolution began. This individual
believes that el-Keib's decision was driven by personal animosity toward Haftar, and the influence of Minister
of Defense Osama alehiwali. The situation is far from resolved, as Haftar and his supporters, particularly in
the Benghazi garrison, continue to claim that the General is the true Chief of Staff. El-Keib and aleruwali are
working to reconcile all of the elements in this conflict as quickly as possible, before the supporters of the two
claimants begin fighting. In the meantime, el-Keib has stated in private that he fully expects Belhaj to attack
al-Mangoush, but the Prime Minister believes that the Colonel is the only officer strong enough to disarm the
militias and avoid a civil war.
6. At the same time, a very sensitive source added that el-Keila and Jalil are attempting to reconcile the
fighting between Misrata and Zintan forces in Tripoli by naming Misrata leader Fawzi Abd All as Minister of
the Interior and alsJuwali, who was commander of the Zintan militiaâ€ž as Minister of Defense. To date,
according to this individual, this effort has met with limited success, as the fighting has continued and the
militias are refusing to disarm until their demands regarding living standards are met.
7. (Source Comment: One very sensitive source noted, that el-Keib is aware of the fact that he is
running out of time to stabilize the situation in Libya. He believes that if he does not disarm the militias and
meet their demands in the next six months there is a good chance of increased fighting among rival groups that
could lead to civil war. In any event, he realizes that the ongoing instability will cause Western governments,
firms, and banks, to hesitate before committing themselves to long term relationships with Libya. El-Keib
believes that Belhaj and his advisors have made the same judgment, and are waiting to fill any vacuum created
by this violence, by establishing a conservative Islamic Republic.)

â€”Sahel/ Mali- will call for Envoy but not yet have named.
Mandate for envoy will be 1) put meat on strategy bones
to include political, security, development, humanitarian, human rights 2) make sure UN is implementing throughout all
agencies 3 mediation in Mali.
--Syria - LB believes key is putting together transitional government;
Grateful for conversation with Robert LB doesn't plan on coming to DC but prefers to see S in NY. Jeff believes
being based in Cairo is right thing for LB. Believes Morsi sincere in initiative but neither Jeff nor LB believe going
anywhere. LB very concerned about ideas coming from Saudis and does not yet have date to go to Riyadh. Concerned
about Bandar.
--Libya- Absolutely agrees that Mitri should turn attention to security. Sent to Beirut over weekend to see
Mitri and put security at top of agenda. Says we will like Mitri a lot. Also suggests when S sees Mikati that she say we will
watch closely how they conduct themselves as chair of Foreign Affairs committee of AL. Jeff had been worried about

Hi Philippe:
Thanks very much for the note. I appreciate it.
I have deep sympathy for what your team and the families of the victims are going through. In Baghdad years
ago, someone I cared for very deeply lost her life with three others in the service of promoting our values
overseas. This experience probably added to the intensity behind my questions and responses as well.
In the interest of diplomacy and extending an olive branch: we should get a drink sometime, off the record.
Best,
Michael

Hi Michael
As you can imagine this has been an intense time for everyone at the State Department, including me.
While I stand by the fundamental principles at issue here, that does not justify my unprofessional response to
your emails. I particularly do not want my words to be a distraction from this tragedy.
I apologize, both for my language and for my tone.
Philippe

Re: Libya internal strife
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the highest levels of
European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1. On the evening of January 22, 2012, according to an official with access to the leadership of the National
Transitional Government (NTC), Libyan President Mustafa Abdul &rill spoke at length with Prime Minister Abdurrahim el-
Keib, stating in a heated exchange that el-Keib's government must take the steps necessary to address the complaints of
the demobilized fighters from the 2011revolution. Jai pointed out that the new government has been discussing this
situation since it was formed in October 2011, and matters have now reached a crisis point, with a group of more than
2,000 disgruntled veterans, supported by students, attacking the NTC offices in Benghazi on January 21, destroying
computer equipment and NTC files. These demonstrators, some of whom threw Molotov cocktails at the NTC
headquarters building, continue to demand better medical care, jobs, payment for their time in the revolutionary army, and
a commitment to transparency on the part of the el-Keib regime; particularly the appointment of cabinet members and
senior officials.
2. According to this source, when el-Keib replied, pointing out that demonstrators were camped outside of his
office in Tripoli. He added that the government had to proceed in a measured and professional manner, Jalil stated in
angry tones, that NTC staffers were beaten and could have been killed during the January 21 incident, pointing out that
this is how the rebellion against IVIuammar al Qaddair began in February 2011. Jalil also warned that Islamist leader
General Abdel Hakim Alamin Beittaj and his supporters, particularly militia commanders from Zintan, Misrata, and other
western regions, are anxiously waiting for the NTC government to collapse. Their goal, in the opinion of this individual, is
to eventually move in and establish a strict Islamic state. Jalii, added that his contacts in the Egyptian Muslim
Brotherhood had been in touch during the preceding week, warning that the threat from Belhaj is very real. El-Keib stated
that he must press Minister of Defense Osama al-Juwafi and Interior Minister Fawzi Abd Ali to be more efficient in
administering their positions. According to this individual, el-Keib fears that al-Juwali, who was a western commander
during the revolution, may be maintaining a secret relationship with Belhaj and his allies. In response, Jalil warned el-Keib

to avoid trying to use the regular military forces posted around Benghazi under General Khalifa Belqasim Halter in an
effort to restrain the former militia troops as such a step could lead to civil war.
3.(Source Comment: In the opinion of an extremely well placed individual, el-Keib is, in fact, increasingly
frustrated by the inefficiency in his regime and the inability of his ministers and administrators to arrange contracts with
foreign firms. He complains that his principal advisors, Minister of Oil Abdulrahrnan Ben Yezza and Minister of Finance
Hassan Ziglam, have been too timid in resolving the questions associated with contracts involving foreign firms, both old
and new. At present it appears that whenever one official raises a question regarding an agreement the entire matter is
put on hold and delayed. In the opinion of this source, el-Keib knows that without these agreements he cannot meet the
demands of the veterans and the students. El-Keib stated in confidence, that he may have made a serious mistake in
removing the former oil/finance minister All Tarhouni from the government. El-Keib also noted that Jalil is shaken by the
January 21 attack on NTC headquarters and is searching for ways to appease the demonstrators. Most recently he
asked Abdel Hafidh Ghoza, his principal deputy and NTC spokesman to step down. Ghoza, who comes from the
Benghazi area, was particularly unpopular with the western troops.)
4. Following the discussion with Jalil, el-Kieb ordered Ziglam and Ngeb Obeda, the head of the Stock Exchange,
to move with all possible speed to address the issue of the foreign contracts and arrange for new vendors to provide the
services demanded by the veterans and students. In this discussion he pointed out that if they cannot deal with this
situation they will not have to worry aboutthe national elections in 2012, Libya will be an Islamic Republic, with E3elhaj as
the ruler. El-Keib pointed out that foreign governments and large oil firms must be aware of this threat and that this will
frighten them into meeting the conditions for foreign contracts set out by the NTC.
5. (Source Comment: According to an extremely sensitive source, el-Keib spoke secretly with Hatter, stating that
he, and those troops loyal to him, should be prepared to move to protect the government in the event of increased
violence. This effort could include moving against Beltiaj and attacking militia forces before they can unite and organize.
El-Keib emphasized that this is for planning purposes only, and no action should be taken until el-Ket gives the order.
He emphasized that he will do everything possible to avoid civil war, but he is now concerned that Jalil will be unable to
deal with the level of hostility against the NTC, and cannot be counted on to take strong positions against Be'hal and his
supporters. In the opinion of this individual, el-Keib cannot back away from his commitment to technicians in senior
positions, but he will press them as hard as he can to have the government respond to the needs of the veterans and
students. El-Keib believes it is not too late to address these problems, but they must move quickly.)

GOP Lawmakers Demand Details Of Deadly Attack On U.S. Consulate In Libya By Ernesto LondoPlo The Washington Post
Thursday, September 27, 2012
Republican lawmakers demanded Wednesday that the Obama administration disclose details about the Sept. 11 attack
on U.S. compounds in eastern Libya that killed an ambassador and three other government employees.

The requests for information about the assault, including any cables about security written by slain Ambassador J.
Christopher Stevens, underscored the extent to which the incident has become a political liability for the White House
during the final stretch of President Obama's reelection campaign.
Lawmakers are asking whether the administration overlooked warning signs about the threat level in Libya, and some
have suggested the security at the U.S. installations in Benghazi was inadequate.
Senior administration officials, including Secretary of State Hillary Rodharn Clinton and Director of National Intelligence
James Clapper, have briefed Congress. But details on the events in Benghazi are still being assembled.
After initially describing the attack as a spontaneous act of mob violence in response to a video that disparaged Islam,
administration officials in recent days have begun to suggest it was a welt planned terrorist attack.
Clinton mentioned the Benghazi assault Wednesday during a speech at the U.N. General Assembly about the rise of
extremist militants in North Africa. Clinton did not specifically ascribe the attack to al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, the
African offshoot of the terrorist organization, but she said the violent deaths of American officials underscored the
importance of defeating the group.
""With a larger safe haven and increased freedom to maneuver, terrorists are seeking to extend their reach and their
networks in multiple directions,"" Clinton said, according to an official transcript of her remarks. ""And they are now
working with other violent extremists to undermine the democratic transitions underway in North Africa, as we
tragically saw in Benghazi.""
U.S, counterterrorism chief Matthew Olsen told the the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee
last week that analysts are exploring whether al-Ofeeda's African branch played a role in the attack. Investigators are also
looking for evidence linking the assault to leaders of Ansar al-Sharia, a loose coalition of hard-line militants with a strong
presence in Libya.
Republican congressmen took the administration to task for what they called contradictory statements about the
Benghazi raid and initial information portraying it as a protest that turned violent.
""This seems like a pre-9/11 mindset â€” treating an act of war solely as a criminal matter,"" a group of 10 congressmen
wrote Wednesday in a letter to the president, referring to the 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States.
Sens. Johnny Isakson (Ga.) and Bob Corker (Tenn.), GOP members of the Foreign Relations Committee, sent a letter
Tuesday to Clinton expressing concern about the 'lack of security preparations made despite a demonstrable increase in
risks to US. officials and facilities in Benghazi.' The senators asked to see any relevant cables that Stevens wrote in the
days before he was killed.
The State Department has launched a type of probe called an accountability panel. The FBI is conducting a separate
criminal investigation into the incident. Citing the inquiries, administration officials have provided few new details about
the Benghazi raid in recent days. US. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice made the most extensive remarks
about the attack four days after the deaths. Her early accounts have come under scrutiny because they suggested that
U.S. government officials did not believe the assault had been well planned or coordinated.
""We look forward to a timely response that explains how the US. ambassador to the United Nations could characterize
an attack on a U.S. consulate so inaccurately,"" Sen. John McCain (Ariz.) and three fellow Republican senators wrote
Wednesday in a letter to Rice.

Septembe 25, 2012
The President
The White House
Washington, D.C. 20500
Dear Mr. President:
We are writing to express grave concern about the events surrounding the terrorist attack
in Benghazi, Libya on September 11, 2012, that led to the murder of the United States
Ambassador to Libya, Christopher Stevens, and three other I_J,S. Government personnel. We
profoundly regret the loss of lives and seek to ensure all necessary steps are being taken to bring
the perpetrators to justice and prevent similar future attacks, While we appreciate your
willingness to provide the House of Representatives with an interagency briefing last week,
many of the members questions were left 'unanswered. To that end, we are seeking additional
information regarding the intelligence leading up to the attack, the security posture of our
embassy, the role former Guantanamo Bay detainees may have played, as well as the way
forward in Libya and, indeed, the region.
We are also disturbed by the public statements made by members of the Administration
that would lead the American public to believe this attack was a protest gone wrong, rather than
what it truly was â€” a terrorist attack on the United States on the anniversary of 9/11. Decades
after al Qaeda attacked our embassies in East Africa, which catalyzed a series of events that led
to the attacks on 9/11, it appears they executed a highly coordinated and well-planned attacked
against us again. Clearly, the threat from al Qaeda and affiliated groups has metastasized; yet we
do not appear to be learning from the past. For example, although brave Americans were once
more murdered by terrorists, it seems our response is to rely on a late-to-the-scene FBI
investigation. Media reports indicate investigators were prevented from arriving in Libya until
more than a week after the attack, but it is not clear that they have gone to Benghazi and have
therefore, been unable to secure valuable information, such as the Ambassador's journal. The
FBI has expertise in these situations, and they have a role to play However, this seems like a
pre 9/11 mindset - treating an act of war solely as a criminal matter, rather than also prioritizing
the gathering of intelligence to prevent future attacks. Moreover, given that violence in the
region continues unabated, what actions are we undertaking to deter terrorists fronl capitalizing

In the aftermath of the terrorist attack on U.S. personnel and facilities in Benghazi, Libya, the Intelligence
Community launched a comprehensive effort to determine the circumstances surrounding the assault and to
identity the mpetrators. We also reviewed all available intelligence to determine if there might be follow-on
attacks against our people or facilities in Libya or elsewhere in the world.
As the Intelligence Community collects and analyzes more information related to the attack, our understanding
of the event continues to evolve. In the immediate aftermath. there was information that led us to assess that the
attack began spontaneously following protests earlier that day at our embassy in Cairo. We provided that initial
assessment to Executive Branch officials and members of Congress, who used that information to discuss the
attack publicly and provide updates as they became available. Throughout our investigation we continued to
emphasize that information gathered was preliminary and evolving.
As we learned more about the attack, we revised our initial assessment to reflect new information indicating that
it was a deliberate and organized terrorist attack carried out by extremists. It remains unclear if any group or
person exercised overall command and control of the attack, and if extremist group leaders directed their
members to participate. However, we do assess that some of those involved were linked to gmups affiliated
with or sympathetic to al-Qa`ida. We continue to make progress, but there remain many unanswered questions.
As more information becomes available our analysis will continue to evolve and we will obtain a more
complete understanding of the circumstances surrounding the terrorist attack.
We continue to support the ongoing FBI investigation and the State Department review of the Benghazi terrorist
attack, pmviding the full capabilities and resources of the Intelligence Community to those efforts. We also will
continue to meet our responsibility to keep Congress fully and currently informed. For its part, the Intelligence
Community will continue to follow the information about the tragic events in Benghazi wherever it leads. The
President demands and expects that we will do this, as do Congress and the American people. As an Intelligence
Community, we owe nothing less than our best efforts in this regard, especially to the families of the four
courageous Americans who lost their lives at Benghazi in service of their country

An interesting piece. The argument that worked on my conservative Obama-hating (Hillary-respecting) friends, which
Keller hints at in the ""slack"" he'll cut us, is that our denunciations of the video aren't an effort to debate the mob; they
are an effort to give ammo to the right side to win the battle that Keller himself identifies (between extremists seeking
to put ""pressure"" on weak transitional governments and the more mainstream majority that supports those
governments). And you could say it worked. Governments stepped up. Extremist groups in Tunisia are backpedalling.
Etc.
So we need to make this argument forcefully.

The Satanic Video
By BILL KELLER
THE alchemy of modern media works with amazing speed. Start with a cheesy anti-Muslim
video that resembles a bad trailer for a Sacha Baron Cohen comedy. It becomes YouTube
fuel for protest across the Islamic world and a pretext for killing American diplomats. That
angry spasm begets an inflammatory Newsweek cover, ""MUSLIM RAGE,"" which in turn
inspires a Twitter hashtag that reduces the whole episode to .a running joke:
""There's no prayer room in this nightclub. #MuslimRage.""
""You lose your nephew at the airport but you can't yell his name because it's JIHAD.
#MuslimRage.""
From provocation to trauma to lampoon in a few short news cycles. It's over in a week,
forgotten in two. Now back to Snooki and Honey Boo Boo.
Except, of course, it's far from over. It moves temporarily off-screen, and then it is back: the
Pakistani retailer accused last week of ""blasphemy"" because he refused to close his shops

during a protest against the video; France locking down diplomatic outposts in about 20
countries because a Paris satirical newspaper has published new caricatures of the prophet.
It's not really over for Saimaa Rushdie, whose new memoir recounts a decade under a
clerical death sentence for the publication of his novel ""The Satanic Verses."" That fatwa, if
not precisely the starting point in our modem confrontation with Islamic extremism, was a
major landmark. The fatwa was dropped in 1998 and Rushdie is out of hiding, but he is still
careful. His book tour for ""Joseph Anton"" (entitled for the pseudonym he used in his
clandestine life) won't be taking him to Islamabad or Cairo.
Rushdie grew up in a secular Muslim family, the son of an Islam scholar. His relationship to
Islam was academic, then literary, before it became excruciatingly personal. His memoir is
not a handbook on how America should deal with the Muslim world. But he brings to that
subject a certain moral authority and the wisdom of an unusually motivated thinker. I invited
him to help me draw some lessons from the stormy Arab Summer.
The first and most important thing Rushdie will tell you is, it's not about religion. Not then,
not now.
When the founding zealot of revolutionary Iran, Ayatollah Khomeini, issued his Rushdie
death warrant in 1989, the imam was not defending the faith; he was trying to regenerate
enthusiasm for his regime, sapped by eight years of unsuccessful war with Iraq. Likewise,
Muslim clerics in London saw the fatwa against a British Indian novelist as an opportunity
to arouse British Muslims, who until that point were largely unstirred by sectarian politics.
""This case was a way for the mosque to assert a kind of primacy over the community,"" the
novelist said the other day. ""I think something similar is going on now.""
It's pretty clear that the protests against that inane video were not spontaneous. Antisecular
and anti-American zealots, beginning with a Cairo TV personality whose station is financed
by Saudi fundamentalists, seized on the video as a way to mobilize pressure on the start-up
governments in Egypt, Tunisia and Libya. The new governmentsâ€¢condemned the violence
and called in police to protect American diplomatic outposts, but not before a good bit of
nervous wobbling.
(One of the principal goals of the extremists, I was reminded by experts at Human Rights
First, who follow the region vigilantly, is to pressure these transitional governments to enact
and enforce strict laws against blasphemy. These laws can then be used to purge secularists
and moderates.)
Like the fanatics in the Middle East and North Africa, our homegrown hatemongers have an
interest in making this out to be a great clash of faiths. The Islamophobes â€” the fringe
demagogues behind the Koran-burning parties and that tawdry video, the more numerous

(mainly right-wing Republican) defenders against the imaginary encroachment of Islamic
law on our domestic freedom â€” are easily debunked. But this is the closest thing we have to
a socially acceptable form of bigotry. And their rants feed the anti-American opportunists.
Rushdie acknowledges that there are characteristics of Islamic culture that make it tinder for
the inciters; an emphasis on honor and shame, and in recent decades a paranoiac sense of the
world conspiring against them. We can argue who is more culpable â€” the hostile West, the
sponsors, the appeasers, the fanatics themselves â€” but Islam has been particularly
susceptible to the rise of identity politics, Rushdie says. ""You define yourself by what
offends you. You define yourself by what outrages you.""
But blaming Islamic culture dismisses the Muslim majorities who are not enraged, let alone
violent, and it leads to a kind of surrender; Oh, it's just the Muslims, nothing to be done. I
detect a whiff of this cultural fatalism in Mitt Romney's patronizing remarks about the
superiority of Israeli culture and the backwardness of Palestinian culture. That would explain
his assertion, on that other notorious video, that an accommodation with the Palestinians is
""almost unthinkable."" That's a strangely defeatist line of thought for a man who professes to
be an optimist and a problem-solver.
Romney and Rushdie are a little more in tune when it comes to mollifying the tender
feelings of irate Muslims.
In his new book, Rushdie recounts being urged by the British authorities who were
protecting him to ""lower the temperature"" by issuing a statement that could be taken for an
apology. He does so. It fills him almost immediately with regret, and the attacks on him are
unabated. He ""had taken the weak position and was therefore treated as a weakling,"" he
writes.
Of the current confrontation, he says, ""I think it's very important that we hold our ground.
It's very important to say, 'We live like this.' ""Rushdie made his post-fatwa life in America
in part because he reveres the freedoms, including the freedom, not so protected in other
Western democracies, to say hateful, racist, blasphemous things.
""Terrible ideas, reprehensible ideas, do not disappear if you ban them,"" he told me. ""They go
underground. They acquire a kind of glamour of taboo. In the harsh light of day, they are out
there and, like vampires, they die in the sunlight.""
And so he would have liked a more robust White House defense of the rights that made the
noxious video possible.
""It's not for the American government to regret what American citizens do. They should just
say, 'This is not our affair and the [violent] response is completely inappropriate.""'

I would cut the diplomats a little more slack when they are trying to defuse an explosive
situation. But I agree that the administration pushed up against the line that separates
prudence from weakness. And the White House request that Google consider taking down
the anti-Muslim video, however gentle the nudge, was a mistake.
By far the bigger mistake, though, would be to write off the aftermath of the Arab Spring as
a lost cause.
It is fairly astounding to hear conservatives who were once eager to invade Iraq â€”
ostensibly to plant freedom in the region â€” now giving up so quickly. on fledgling
democracies that might actually be won over without 10 bloody years of occupation. Or
lamenting our abandonment of that great stabilizing autocrat Hosni Mubarak. Or insisting
that we bully and blackmail the new governments to conform to our expectations.
These transition governments present an opportunity. Fortifying the democratic elements in
the post-Arab Spring nation-building, without discrediting them as American stooges, is a
delicate business. The best argument we have is not our aid money, though that plays a part.
It is the choice between two futures, between building or failing to build a rule of law, an
infrastructure of rights, and an atmosphere of tolerance. One future looks something like
Turkey, prospering, essentially secular and influential. The other future looks a lot like
Pakistan, a land of fear and woe.
We can't shape the Islamic world to our specifications. But if we throw up our hands, if we
pull back, we now have a more vivid picture of what will fill the void.

HRC has been a critical voice on Libya in administration deliberations, at NATO, and in contact group meetings â€” as well
as the public face of the U.S. effort in Libya. She was instrumental in securing the authorization, building the coalition,
and tightening the noose around Qadhafi and his regime.
February 25â€” HRC announces the suspension of operations of the Libyan embassy in Washington.
February 26 â€” HRC directs efforts to evacuate all U.S. embassy personnel from Tripoli and orders the closing of the
embassy.
February 26 -- HRC made a series of calls to her counterparts to help secure passage of UNSC 1970, which imposes
sanctions on Gaddafi and his family and refers Qadhafi and his cronies to the ICC
February 28 â€” HRC travels to Geneva, Switzerland for consultations with European partners on Libya. She gives a major
address in which she says: ""Colonel Qadhafi and those around him must be held accountable for these acts, which
violate international legal obligations and common decency. Through their actions, they have lost the legitimacy to
govern. And the people of Libya have made themselves
clear: It is time for Qadhafi to go â€” now, without further violence or delay."" She also works to secure the suspension of
Libya from membership in the Human Rights Council.
Early March â€” HRC appoints Special Envoy Chris Stevens to be the U.S.
representative to Benghazi
March 14â€” HRC travels to Paris for the G8 foreign minister's meeting.
She meets with INC representative Jibril and consults with her colleagues on further UN Security Council action. She
notes that a no-fly zone will not be adequate.

1973 authorizes a no-fly zone over Libya and ""all necessary measures"" - code for military action - to protect civilians
against Gaddafi's army.
March 19â€” HRC travels to Paris to meet with European and Arab leaders to prepare for military action to protect
civilians. That night, the first U.S. air strikes halt the advance of Gaddafi's forces on Benghazi and target Libya's air

Contact Group comprising 20-plus countries to coordinate efforts to protect civilians and plan for a post-Qadhafi Libya.
She is instrumental in setting up a rotating chair system to ensure regional buy-in.
April 14 â€” HRC travels to Berlin for NATO meetings. She is the driving force behind NATO adopting a communiquÃ© that
calls for Qadhafi's departure as a political objective, and lays out three clear military objectives: end of attacks and
threat of attacks on civilians; the removal of Qadhafi forces from cities they forcibly entered; and the unfettered
provision of humanitarian access.

a responsible investigation and a careful and inclusive approach to creating a new executive council.
Early August HRC secures written pledges from the TNC to an inclusive, pluralistic democratic transition. She
continues to consult with European and Arab colleagues on the evolving situation.

Jake- Interesting report. Gene is closer to the action and I defer to him on the latest Jail-ian thinking
and machinations vis-a-vis the cabinet and INC. I hadn't heard about ENI-related corruption but
wouldn't be surprised.
On the federalism issue,. Jail is right to be concerned about eastern agitation for autonomy. A
cabinet chance won't solve that problem, though. Nor will recruiting Belhaj and Islamist fighters to
take on the Bardans. To the contrary, it would only lead to unwanted bloodshed - the large Obeid
tribe still nurses a serious grudge against Belhaj and his ilk for the Islamists' presumed role in killing their
beloved Gen. Yunis last July and would probably put up a fierce fight.
The cabinet and INC need to have a serious discussion with the Bargans - if they aren't already
doing so - about how power and resources are to be distributed in the new Libya. The Libyans held
similarly heated debates on this very topic in the early1950s as they held their first parliamentary
elections and drafted their constitution (there were actually violent skirmishes in connection with
those elections, and Washington delayed the arrival of the first US ambassador until after things had
calmed down). Hopefully the current leadership can negotiate these issues peaceably in the
corning months. Of course, we and the UN and our other partners should encourage them to do so.

Let me know your thoughts:
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the highest levels of
European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1.On April 17, 2012 Libyan National Transitional Council (NTC) President Mustafa Abdel Jalil stated to a close
advisor that he is considering when, or even if, to hold a vote of no confidence in the NTC regarding support for the
government of Prime Minister Abdel Rahman al-Keib. According to a source with access to the NTC leadership, Jalil
realizes that a majority of the Council members no longer support el-Keib and his cabinet of Western educated technical
experts. Jaili continues to believe that, for the moment, the most important issue facing the NTC is the federalist
movement toward a semi-autonomous state in the Eastern region of Cyrenaica (Barge in Arabic). This situation continues
to complicate the NTC efforts to stabilize the country. With this in mind, Jalil expressed concern that a dramatic vote of no
confidence for el-Keib will weaken the entire NTC by association. Instead, according to this source, Jalil is considering
delaying a CiOCISI011, possibly putting it off until an elected legislature is in place in the late summer or early fall of 2012.
2. (Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, the NTC has been able to reach a temporary
understanding with the eastern federalists, allowing the separatists to administer their local regions, while deferring to the
NTC for national and international issues. The complicating factor at this point lies in reaching a determination regarding
who has authority over new contracts with oil companies and other international firms. As of the week of April 16, 2012,
no decision has been reached on this point. The bulk of the NTC leadership is drawn from Barge, and Jalil now believes
they can control the situation if they can establish an organized central government. In particular, Jalil, according to a
sensitive source, is increasingly confident that the eastern roots of the NTC will allow him to balance the federalist
movement against the need for a sense of national unity. In the opinion of this source, el-Keib's future depends on Jalil's
opinion of his capacity to deal with this complex situation.)
3. Minister of Defense Ousama al Juwali is viewed by Jalil as the most important western Libyan in el-Keib's
cabinet, and the President and the leaders of the NTC had hoped that he would be able to deal with the confused security
situation in Tripoli. However, while he did receive assurances from General Abdel Hakim Alamin Belhaj regarding
possible assistance from his Islamist troops if fighting broke out between the National Army and the militia's loyal to the
eastern federalists. Unfortunately, from Jalil's point of view, this effort seems to have emboldened Belhaj and heightened
tension between the eastern and western portions of the country. According to this source, after reviewing the federalist
problem, Dr Abd al-Nasser Shamata, the head of the Crisis Management for the NTC, believes that el-Keib, al Juwali, Oil
Minister Abdulrahman Ben Yezza, and the bulk of the cabinet should be replaced by people drawn from within the NTC,
individuals who are in touch with the concerns of the Libyan people of all tribes and political groups. In the opinion of this
source Jalil is factoring this position into his decision on el-Keib.
4. Regarding the existing relationships with international oil firms, Shamata told Jalil that for the most part the
existing fields are continuing to produce and the owners have worked out security arrangements with local political and
tribal leaders. However, since el-Keib and Ben Yezza have been unable to bring order to the national administration, it is
difficult for firms to initiate new projects, since it is not clear who has the authority or the desire to sign such
agreements. Shamata stated forcefully that the Prime Minister, whoever he is, must establish an orderly administration
before full advantage can be gained from the oil fields. In the meantime, Shamata warns that his office has found
evidence of corruption between local officials and international firms. In this regard, he stated that local representatives of
the Italian national oil firm (ENI) have made problematic arrangements with local officials in the western part of the
country, where their oil fields are located. He added that most of these ENI employees are Libyans, but he believes ENI
management in Italy is aware of this situation. Shamata pointed out, without additional comment, that Ben Yezza is a
long time senior official of ENI.
5. In the opinion this source, Shamata and Jalil are not planning to publicize these charges regarding ENI, at least
until they decide how best to move forward on el-Keib, whether to allow the Prime Minister more time to address his
problems, proceed with the vote of no confidence or quietly ask him to step down on his own.
6. (Source Comment: According to this source, el-Keib is under fire primarily as a result of his failure to bring
order to the National Army, disarm independent militias, and establish security throughout the country. The leading
opposition to el-Keib is based in the Political Issues committee of the NTC, and as many as 42 of the 73 active NTC
members will vote against el-Keib if Jalil brings this matter to a vote. The source warns that these numbers are provided
by members of this Political committee, who may have their own agenda. A two thirds majority is required for the no
confidence vote, however; several senior members of the NTC are reluctant to take such a step until a constituent
assembly has been elected. They do not want this to look like the decision of a small group of people.)

Cheryl â€”
This is a quick note to say that the hearings on Benghazi are going fine, from my perspective. Pat Kennedy has been
terrific substantive, precise, and firm in the face of some outlandish behavior. We continue to fend off questions
about the unclass talking points. And I think the
time line narrative is helpful.
I will call to give you a more complete read-out

Sen. John McCain renewed his attacks on U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice on Tuesday, but he's gone soft on
Hillary.
As she wraps up her tenure at Foggy Bottom and mulls over a possible 2016 White House bid, Secretary of
State Hillary Clinton's decade-old bipartisan friendship with McCain appears to have helped shield her from
GOP fire â€” even as her agency finds itself in the thick of a partisan battle over Benghazi.
But McCain and Clinton also are battle-tested veterans of Washington who have seen their families become
targets of nasty political attacks â€” and who have often turned to laughter to get through it all. For Clinton, it
was Monica Ii ewinsky; for McCain it was the smear campaign during the 2000 GOP primary aimed at his
Bangladesh-born adopted daughter.
""I think it was the best version of strange bedfellows and at the same time a perfect match,"" Tmnera Luzzatto,
Clinton's Senate chief of staff from 2001 to 2009, said of her former boss's relationship with McCain. ""They
share a sense of public service but also a sense of humor.""
McCain, a leading voice on defense and foreign policy matters, has spent weeks belittling Rice as ""not very
bright,"" incompetent and not qualified"" to succeed Clinton as secretary of state. Rice s offense: incorrectly
characterizing the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Libya as sparked by spontaneous protests rather than as a
deliberate act of terrorism --- a lapse she has blamed on administration talking points that were approved by
intelligence officials.
But the Arizona Republican has largely spared Clinton from any criticism over the Sept. 11 Benghazi assault
that killed Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans. When Clinton tried to fall on her sword,
saying she alone was responsible for diplomatic security, McCain wouldn't have it He called Clinton's act
""laudable"" but was adamant that the buck stops with President Barack Obama and that he would try to block
Rice's possible nomination as the nation's top diplomat.
While McCain seemed to dial back his attacks on Rice over the weekend, the senator was at it again Tuesday
after he and fellow GOP Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire sat
down with Rice at the Capitol to quiz her about why the Obarna administration mischaracterized the attack as
other than terrorism.
""We are significantly troubled by many of the answers that we got and some that we didn't get,"" McCain told
reporters after the meeting. ""It is clear the information that she gave the American people was incorrect.""

Asked pointedly why he hasn't been as critical of Clinton, McCain did not directly mention the secretary, who
has decided against staying on for a second term.
""I've said it continuously that the State Department has responsibility,"" McCain told POLITICO. ""I have been
very critical of the State Department and their actions. I've been critical of everybody's actions.""
It wasn't the first time this year that McCain came to the former New York senator's defense. In July, McCain
took to the Senate floor and denounced Rep. Michele Bachmann and four other House Republicans for alleging
that longtime Clinton aide Hurna Abedin was working with the Muslim Brotherhood to infiltrate the top rungs
of the U.S. government.
The allegations, McCain said in his speech, amount to an ""unwarranted and unfounded attack on an honorable
woman, a dedicated American and a loyal public servant?'
The gratitude from the Clinton camp that day was palpable,
""We were all so very moved when Sen. McCain took to the Senate floor that day. It was nothing short of
remarkable,"" said Clinton's longtime spokesman, Philippe Reines. But after being around him all those years
in the Senate and since, and seeing firsthand his fondness and respect for Huma, it was not surprising at all
""And when someone of Sen. McCain's stature stood up for her,"" he said, really gives people pause before
trafficking in vicious and disgusting lies.""
McCain first met Clinton when she was first lady and got to know her better as he worked with her husband in
the mid-1990s on normalizing diplomatic relations with Vietnam, where the former Navy pilot endured 5V2
years as a prison of war after his plane was shot down. The daughter of a World War II Navy officer herself,
Clinton admired McCain's military service, and the two spent countless hours together at markups and hearings
of the Senate Armed Services Committee after the Sept. Ii, 2001, attacks.
""Like her husband, she really studies the issues, she is a policy wonk, and I mean that in a complimentary
fashion,"" McCain told POLITICO on Tuesday. ""She puts people at ease, she is a role model to a lot of young
women in America -- my daughter [Meghan] admires her a great deal.

""Some people you hit it off with, some people not so much. She and I seemed to hit it off with each other and
enjoy each other's company.""
Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.) has traveled extensively with
McCain and Clinton and watched their relationship grow.
""To put it mildly, they don't always agree. John and I have been pestering and pressuring the administration,
including the secretary, on current matters like Syria, that we're not doing enough in Syria,"" Lieberman told
POLITICO. ""But there is a strong, mutually respectful, personal relationship, and it's quite cordial.
""When we're all together, we not only talk seriously â€” we laugh a lot.""
In 2008, McCain and Clinton were almost presidential rivals â€” if not for a young, charismatic upstart named
Barack Obama. Four years earlier, the two senators found themselves side by side on a small cruise ship in the
Arctic Circle, bundled up in jackets and ball caps and gazing at the ""midnight sun"" in Svalbard.
Invited by the Norwegian government, Clinton and McCain flew to the remote archipelago â€” famous for its 24
hours of continuous sunlight â€” to see firsthand the effects of climate change on the melting ice cap.
It was ""a shared experience being in a place where we sat outside and watched the sun go down and just touch
the horizon and then go back up,"" McCain recalled.
Svalbard would be the first of many trips abroad together for the future secretary of state and 2008 GOP
standard-bearer: During a 2006 visit to Estonia, Clinton reportedly challenged McCain to a vodka-drinking
contest, the two have frequently met up at the annual Munich Security Conference, and they've dropped into
military hot spots like Iraq.
""They are two people I would invite to a party,"" said Graham, another frequent traveling companion.
But as Clinton exits the world stage â€” albeit perhaps temporarily â€” Graham and other Republicans are
signaling she may not escape the Benghazi debacle entirely unscathed.

Make Up Turned Break Up
By MAUREEN DOWD
WASHINGTON
Are the Republican senators unreasonable? Or is the secretary of state-manquÃ© undiplomatic? Did the senators
sandbag Susan Rice? Or did Rice further inflame a tense situation? Is it a case of shooting the messenger and
playing politics? Or is national security dangerously infected with politics?
It seems as if it would have been simple enough for Rice to quickly admit that the administration talking points
she used on the Sept. 16 Sunday shows about the slaughter in Benghazi were misleading. But she went silent.
She has no wartime consigliere and, aside from the president's angry postelection defense of Rice, the White
House â€” perhaps relieved that she -14,as taking the heat rather than the president â€” wasn't running a strong
damage control operation that clarified matters.
Still, on last Sunday's talk shows, John McCain and Lindsey Graham softened their tone a bit. ""She's not the
problem,"" McCain said The problem is the president of the United States,"" for failing to swiftly tell
Americans what his intelligence agencies had confirmed: that Benghazi was a terrorist attack involving Al
Qa.eda. affiliates.
When Rice asked to come to the Hill to meet with some of her Republican critics, it seemed dÃ©tente was nigh.
But somehow the hour-and-a-half powwow caused an escalation, with McCain, Graham and Senator Kelly
Ayotte of New Hampshire emerging to say they had more reservations than before. Senator Bob Corker of
Tennessee, who's scheduled to meet with Rice on Wednesday, suggested that she would be better suited to run
the Democratic National Committee than State. If Rice can't soothe the egos of some cranky G.O.P. pots, how
would she negotiate with China?

Senator Susan Collins of Maine, the soft-spoken ranking member on the homeland security committee, hasn't
been part of this shrill debate. Though they had met only once or twice, Collins agreed to introduce Rice to the
Foreign Relations Committee in 2009 when Rice was nominated as the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Rice's
grandparents immigrated from Jamaica to Portland, Maine.
""I don't bear any animus to her at all,"" the senator said. ""In fact, to the contrary.""
But she said she is ""troubled"" by Rice's role. ""If I wanted to be secretary of state,"" Collins observed, ""I would
not go on television and perform what was essentially a political role.""
Collins drew up a list of questions to ask Rice at their one-on-one hourlong meeting slated for Wednesday. She
wants Rice to explain how she could promote a story ""with such certitude"" about a spontaneous demonstration
over the anti-Muslim video that was so at odds with the classified information to which the ambassador had
access. (It was also at odds with common sense, given that there were Al Qaeda sympathizers among the rebel
army members that overthrew Muarrunar el-Qaddafi with help from the U.S. â€” an intervention advocated by
Rice â€” and Islamic extremist training camps in the Benghazi area.)
The F.B.I. interviewed survivors of the attack in Germany and, according to some senators, had done most of
the interviews of those on site by Sept. 15, the day before Rice went on TV, and established that there was no
protest. Collins wants to learn if the F.B.I. had failed to communicate that, or if they had communicated it and
Rice went ahead anyway?
When Rice heard the president of the Libyan National Congress tell Bob Schieffer on ""Face the Nation,"" right
before her appearance, that 50 people had been arrested who were either foreign or affiliated with or
sympathized with Al Qaeda, why did she push back with the video story? ""Why wouldn't she think what the
Libyan president said mattered?"" Collins wondered.
Why did Rice say on ABC News's ""This Week,"" that ""two of the four Americans who were killed were there
providing security""? Rice was referring to the two ex-Navy SEAL team members who were C.I.A. security
officers working on a base about a mile away. ""They weren't there to protect Ambassador Stevens,"" Collins
said. ""That wasn't their job.""
Rice also said that ""we had a substantial security presence with our personnel"" â€” which was clearly not the
case. Collins wants to know Rice's basis for saying on ABC that the attacks were ""a direct result of a heinous
and offensive video."" And why did she say ""a small number of people"" came to the consulate to protest, when
that phrase is not in her talking points? Collins is curious why Rice is not angrier, if, as she insists, she was
repeating what she was told. ""I'd be furious at the White House and F.B.I. and intelligence community for
destroying my credibility,"" the senator said.
Collins said that before she would support Rice for secretary of state, she needs to ascertain what was really
going on. ""Did they think admitting that it was an Al Qaeda attack would destroy the narrative of Libya being a
big success story?"" Collins asked. As one of the administration champions of intervening in Libya, Rice was
surely rooting for that success story herself.

SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the highest levels of
European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1. As of the morning of July 6, an individual with access to the information stated in confidence that Libyan National
Transitional Council (NTC) President Mustafa Abdel Jalil remains committed to a transfer of power to a popularly elected
government; however, he is prepared to ex-tend the life of the NTC as a guarantor of stability for the Libyan people
following the July 7, 2012 election for seats in a 200-member General National Congress (GNC). Jaifi realizes that 2.7
million Libyans have registered to vote and are generally anxious to replace the increasingly unpopular NTC. That said,
JAI expects the voting to lead to a period of confusion and he will not abandon his authority until the results are fixed.
2. Jalil is also frustrated by the fact that during its eight-month tenure of the administration of Prime Minister Abclel
Rahman el-Keib - who was appointed by the NTC was unable to provide solutions for Libya's long list of needs: a
functioning justice system, a reconciliation process for officials who served the old administration, the disarming of
militia, building functional national security forces, rebuilding destroyed areas, and delivering basic services such as
healthcare.
3. At the same time, outside of the oil sector, much of Libya's economy is stagnant, and in the opinion of Western
security officials, lacks the government's go-ahead to restart public sector infrastructure contracts. In addition,
international advisers and foreign investors are reluctant to return to an environment where the government will not
sign long term agreements and cannot guarantee security.
4.(Source Comment: According to an extremely sensitive source, Jalil continues to believe that this chaotic situation
should not be surprising. He regularly points out that eight months is not a sufficient amount of time to build functioning
institutions from the remnants of the regime of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi. The old regime featured a
dysfunctional bureaucracy, idiosyncratic rule, and anti-institutionalism. Additionally, Jaill now re
Ializes that due to
pronounced incompetence and a lack of will to take unpopular decisions the el-Keib government also failed to make
progress in the few areas where it could have achieved meaningful change. The towns of Sirte and Tawargha are
representative of the situation in the countryside where people lost their homes in the conflict and have been living in
temporary camps with limited ability to register and vote in their home district. Jalil has been urged by contacts in the
French and Italian Governments to guarantee the rights of people across the country in particular, he has serious
concerns as to whether or not supporters of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi in his hometown of Sirte will be
included in the future political processes of the new Libya; if they are not allowed to vote by local militiamen. At the
same time, the fighting between Libyan Arabs and Tebta tribesmen in the Kufra area threatens to prevent any voting
there. Jalil has been warned that the NTC regulations now state that members of the National Army are not allowed to
vote or run for office, which is a disincentive for armed militia brigade members to become legitimate soldiers.)
5.This well informed individual believes that despite these flaws, the new government created by the July 7 election will
eventually have the mandate to take the difficult decisions that can create a reconciliation process. Jalil will work to
maintain order in this transition period, and finally reach his goal of creating a situation where the government can
rebuild homes and restore sufficient law and order; allowing those in Sirte, Tawargha, Kufra, and throughout the rest of
the country to live in their hometowns, establishing a situation where a true civil society can develop.

6. Jail!, in conversations with the leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood (MB), and separately with liberal leader Ali
Tarhouni, has acknowledged that the central government's top priority must be security and that the NTC has been
unable to provide it. That said, Jail! and Minister of Defense Ousarna alefuwali have pledged to provide 30,000 to 40,000
security personnel for election day to prevent similar incidents to the July 1 attack on Benghazi's election headquarters.
In that case eastern federalists entered the building, where ballot papers were burned and ballot boxes destroyed.
Similarly, these federalist forces are suspected of the attack on July 5 that burned down Ajdabiya's main storage centre
for election materials.
7. In the opinion of this individual, although those responsible for the Benghazi attack were pro-federalist, it has not
been proven that they were members of the self-appointed Cyrenaican National Council (MC), whose military arm set
up a roadblock in Wadi al-Ahmar on Libya's major east-west highway to demand that Cyrenaica get as many seats in the
GNC as Tripolitania. Thus far, neither the CNC nor any other group has publicly stated that they intend to use violence to
disrupt the elections. (Note: Under the current system Tripolitania will have 120 seats in the GNC, Cyrenaica (Barge) 62,
and Fezzan in the South 18.)

Regional Edition
SECTION: EDITORIAL COPY; Pg. A25
HEADLINE: It's not about Rice
BYLINE: Richard Cohen
BODY:
In 1953, an Army officer by the name of Irving Peress was promoted from captain to major. Peress was a
leftist, possibly a communist, and word of his advancement in rank reached Sen. Joseph McCarthy in
Washington. He asserted that the promotion proved the Army was ""soft on communism,"" and he launched an
investigation that transfixed the nation. Peress, by the way, was a mere dentist. He was the Susan Rice of his
day.
Rice, of course, is a much more substantial figure. She is the U.N. ambassador, a friend of Barack Obama's
and a member of his Cabinet. Still, the attack on her is so disproportionate to what she is accused of having
done - just what was it, exactly? - that as in the Peress case, you have to conclude that there is something more
at work.
At first, I thought we were witnessing just another example of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) doing his
Rumpelstiltskin number - throwing a fit and stomping his feet. It was McCain who first leveled the solemn
charge that Rice had lied to the Sunday TV shows about the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya.
She had characterized it as a spontaneous riot when it was, in fact, a planned attack by a local al-Qaeda affiliate.
But Rice was hewing to the early line established by the intelligence community. If the CIA and others were
wrong - or deceptive - then so, inevitably, was she.
Just as surely as day follows night, McCain's broadside was echoed by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). It
was soon taken up by 97 Republicans in the House who found Rice unqualified to become secretary of state - a
post to which she has not been nominated. ""Ambassador Rice is widely viewed as having willfully or
incompetently misled the American public,"" they bellowed.
I think Rice would make a dandy secretary of state. She's close to the president, and that matters a great
deal. But she is also seen as overly political and that, as much as her version of Benghazi, is what troubles some
others. Oddly enough, Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.), a former presidential candidate and another potential
secretary of state, is seen as much more of a statesmen. He is indeed an independent foreign-policy thinker who
has, as in days of old, restored the prestige and importance of the Foreign Relations Committee, of which he is
chairman.
But the awful truth is that it hardly matters who Obama chooses. Foreign policy is run from the White
House and not the State Department. Hillary Clinton is about to retire, and while she has done a commendable

job at Foggy Bottom, we cannot expect the inevitable book by her to reveal a Clinton Doctrine. For the most
part, she executed, not initiated, foreign policy.
So what is this fuss all about? Not Rice, that's for sure. It has turned instead into an expression of unease
about Obarna's foreign policy and its politicization. The unfortunate Peress came to personify the government's
alleged indifference to the (equally alleged) communist infiltration of the military and virtually everything else
(with the possible exception of the American Legion), Similarly, Rice has become the personification of
unhappiness with the use of intelligence leaks to buff Obanaa's foreign policy image and the conducting of an
amorphous foreign policy. Like Churchill's famous pudding, it lacks theme.
Syria is an example. U.S. inaction has allowed the crisis to fester. Bashar al-Assad's regime might be
dusting off its formidable arsenal of chemical weapons, further evidence of how chaotic this crisis has become,
but much of the time the White House has just trailed after Turkey or France. The war has spread, a refugee
calamity has developed, 40,000 people have died, and jihadists have come to play a prominent role. The Obarna
administration has been as lethargic on Syria as it initially was with Libya.
This sense of an aimless foreign policy, one lacking any moral fervor (or fiber) irritates conservatives much
more than liberals. It certainly enrages McCain, who cannot stomach the big guys kicking little guys around. He
sees an administration that will not engage the American people on matters of foreign policy - make a case for
intervention, not just say it's too hard to do.
The attack on Rice is unfair and excessive. But the issue is not the person but what she represents - in this
case, the administration's 'mobility to articulate a foreign policy that marries American morality to American
power, not merely American politics.

1.During early December 2012 Libyan Prime Minister Ali Zidan and President Mohamed
Magariaf concluded a series of discreet meetings with selected tribal leaders from Eastern Cyrenaica
region (Barge in Arabic), after which they agreed that the problem of the growing Barge federalist
movement is gaining strength and will again become a major issue in early 2013. At the same time
National Libyan Army (NLA) Chief of Staff General Youssef al Mangoush warned Zidan that the
Eastern tribes have rearmed and reequipped in the past three months and are preparing to reassert
their desire for a degree of autonomy in early 2013. Mangoush also advised that the situation in the
region between Benghazi and the Egyptian border may become increasingly complicated as Salafist
-fighters from Egypt continue to arrive in Benghazi. Mangoush reported that his staff officers have
been advised in secret by aids to Egyptian Army Chief of Staff, General Mohammed al-Sissi, that,
acting under instructions from Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi, military and security forces are
taking steps to detain or neutralize extreme Salafist pare-military groups and that a number of these
fighters are fleeing to Libya. According to the Libyan commander, these Salafist fighters are
comfortable in Benghazi, where many of them served with Libyan revolutionary forces during the
rebellion against former dictatorMuammar al Qaddafi.
2. In the opinion of this individual, Zidan and Magariaf, after consulting with Minister of Oil
Abdulbari al-Arusi, decided to move forward with a plan dating back to the administration of former
Oil Minister Abdulrahman Ben Yezza dividing the National Oil Corporation""s (NOC) production and
exploration divisions into two separate firms. With this in mind, al-Arusi began discussing the matter
with concerned parties in late November and early December. Included in these discussions were
meetings with members of the local federalist council in Benghazi and tribal officials from Barqa. In
these sessions Al-Arusi described a new structure managing all existing oil-related firms, while

building new operations and raising funds from investors outside of the country. This firm will be
divided into two branches, one in Benghazi and one in Tripoli. Al-Arusi added that the cost of this
project will range between fifty (50) and sixty (6o) billion dinars.
3.(Source Comment: According to a separate sensitive source, this concept came as a surprise
to most of the local officials in Tripoli and Benghazi. This individual added that while the Western
officials continue to have some questions about the matter, the Benghazi/Barqa leaders were, in al-
Arusi's opinion, positive, if not enthusiastic about the new initiative. According to al-Arusi, doubts on
either side relate to the mistrust that remains between the two regions, but he is determined to move
ahead in this matter and is supported by Zidan and Magariaf. According to this source, the president
and prime minister are convinced that they must deal with this internal East-West issue before they
can bring a stable security environment to the country, and disarm the remaining independent
militias in each part of the country. This individual added that in private discussions al-Arusi stated
that the tentative name for this new oil entity will be the National Corporation for Oil Refining and
Petrochemicals Industry, with its headquarters in Tripoli, and substantive offices in Benghazi. Like
the NOC, the new firm will fall under the Ministry of Oil and Gas.)
4. In addition, this sensitive source noted that Al-Arusi is also discussing the creation of a
company specializing in mechanical construction related to the oil and gas industry. This firm would
be based in Benghazi. The minister stated in private that he believes such a company can be
developed to compete with international firms in this very complex field. He also believes that such a
firm must be managed by experienced, scientifically-qualified Libyans, with reputations for honesty.
He noted that until as such a cadre is developed it may be desirable to use experts from Egypt to fill
the immediate needs of the firm. Al-Arusi believes this firm should have offices in all of the oil fields
and loading facilities. The minister also plans to establish an office in Benghazi, similar to Tripoli's oil
institute, a facility that will train students looking to pursue oil-related studies. In addition, al-Arusi is
making plans to reopen the Higher Petroleum Institute in Tobruk, which was closed by Qaddafi at the
beginning of the revolution. He told a sensitive source that he expects the Tobruk institute to produce
thousands of skilled engineers to provide Libyan managers for the future operation of the oil sector.
Once the final details are set the Zidan regime will submit the entire package for parliamentary
approval and financing
6. (Source Comment: Advisors to Magariaf state in confidence that, in their opinion this
comprehensive plan for the oil industry will face opposition from individuals with links to foreign oil
firms, primarily foreign trained engineers who hope to see greater privatization in the oil an oil
services industries in the wake of the revolution. According to a particularly sensitive source, Zidan is
particularly concerned about this possibility, noting that these individuals see this issue in strictly
business terms, not considering the political issues, and the East â€” West situation, that are all part of
the overall picture in Libya. At present al-Arusi believes that foreign oil firms remain concerned
about the unsettled security situation throughout Libya, however; he is convinced that this new plan
will help address this situation. At present, he noted that the large Italian oil firm ENI is stepping up
its operations throughout Libya, and, with the support of the Italian Government, will continue to
increase its investment in Libya in an effort to get ahead of the other foreign firms concerned in
Libya.)

Ni,
Went down to talk to Eric this evening, but missed him. Sent him note, and will follow up tomorrow. Also had long talk
with Pat. He's coping, but as you well know it's not easy.
I like the Greg Starr idea.

Subject: Inquiry Into Libya Attack Is Sharply Critical of State Dept. (NYT)
WASHINGTON (New York Times) - An independent inquiry into the attack on the United States diplomatic
mission in Libya that killed four Americans on Sept. 11 sharply criticizes the State Department for a lack of
seasoned security personnel and relying on untested local militias to safeguard the compound, Congressional
and State Department officials said Tuesday night
The investigation into the attacks on the diplomatic mission and C.LA. annex that killed Ambassador I.
Christopher Stevens and three others also faulted State Department officials in Washington for ignoring
requests from officials at the American Embassy in Tripoli for more guards and safety upgrades to the
diplomatic mission.
The panel also blamed the State Department for waiting for specific warnings of imminent attacks to act
rather than adapting security procedures and protocols to a deteriorating security environment By this spring,
Benghazi, a hotbed of militant activity in eastern Libya, had experienced a string of assassinations and attacks,
including one on a British envoy's motorcade.
Finally, the report also blamed two major State Department bureaus â€” diplomatic security and Near Eastern
affairs â€” for failing to coordinate and plan adequate security at the mission. The panel also determined that a
number of officials had shown poor leadership.
In response to the panel's findings, Secretary of State Hillary Rodhana Clinton said in a letter to Congress
that she was acceptiung all 29 of the panel's recommendations, several of which are classified.
Mrs. Clinton is taking specific steps to correct the problems, according to officials. They say the State
Department is asking permission from Congress to transfer $1.3 billion from funds that had been allocated for
spending in Iraq. This includes $553 million for additional Marine security guards; $130 million for diplomatic
security personnel; and $691 million for improving security at installations abroad.
On Monday, an independent panel that was established to investigate the attack presented the report to the
State Department. The panel, called an accountability review board, is led by Thomas R. Pickering, a veteran
diplomat. It includes four other members, among them Mike Mullen, the retired admiral who served as
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The board is authorized by a 1986 lavv intended to strengthen security at
United States diplomatic missions.
The State Department sent a lengthy classified version of the report to Congress on Tuesday. Mr. Pickering
and Admiral Mullen are scheduled to meet with members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and
House Foreign Affairs Committee in closed session on Wednesday.
On Thursday, William J. Burns and Thomas R Nides, both deputy secretaries of States, will testitY to both
panels. Mrs. Clinton, who is stillrecovering from a concussion she suffered last week after fainting while sick
from a stomach flu, is at home this week. The head of the House panel, Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a
Florida Republican, however, has made clear that she planned to ask Mrs. Clinton to testify at a future time

Benghazi's Deep Throat fingers Islamist Leaders for
Attacks as State Dept Criticized on Consular Security
Posted on 12/19/2012 by Juan
The report saying that security was inadequate at the compound that the US had adopted as its ad hoc
consulate in 13enghazio Libya dominates today's headlines. That conclusion is obvious. The
""consulate"" was just a private residence taken over for this purpose by the US in the city, It was not
constructed to be a US government building in a potentially hostile city.
I met a person who worked there when I was in Benghazi in June, and she told me that it wasn't even
clear if the consulate would be retained after the first of this year It was possibly temporary,
depending on Congressional funding. (The Tea Party House hasn't been good on meeting requests for
embassy security funds).
The more interesting question than why ad hoc arrangements should have been made for a consulate
during and after the Libyan revolution (the answer to which seems fairly obvious) is, who is
responsible for the string of assassinations and acts of violence in the city, of which the RPG attack on
the consulate on September 11 was only one? Benghazi, with a population of over one million in a
country of 6.5 million, is Libya's second largest city and1/1
e'as the epicenter of the revolution against the
government of Muammar Qaddafi in 2011.
On November 22, Benghazi police chief Farej Darssi was assassinated. In October a police colonel
barely avoided deathâ€” his car was wired to explode, A Libyan intelligence officer was killed in
September. A general was assassinated in August. Some of these figures had worked for Qaddafi but
had defected to the revolution. Qaddafi's security forces were responsible for the 1996 massacre of
hardline fundamentalists at Abu Salim prison, and for making others just disappear, Likely the same
shadowy cells that attacked the US consulate are behind the attacks on Benghazi police and army
officers.
There may have been a break in the case. Last Saturday, Benghazi security forces loyal to the elected
government in Tripoli, captured a man they suspected of being involved with the groups behind the
violence. And, he appears to have been willing to spill the beans. So let's call him the Libyan Deep
Throat.
Deep Throat is so knowledgeable about the conspiracies facing the city and so dangerous to those
hatching them that the latter immediately attempted to spring him from jail.
On Sunday morning, militants attacked the police facility next to the holding cell where the man is
being detained. A policeman at that station died in a hail of bullets from the attackers, and they called
for back-up. The police car that sped to the scene as ambushed and three policemen in it were killed.
Still, the police stood their ground and fought off the assault, and they kept their valuable suspect in
custody, with all his valuable testimony.
Shortly after midnight, on Monday morning, small explosives were set off at the Garyounis police
station in Benghazi, damaging a couple of automobiles but otherwise doing little damage. Then
explosives were set off at al-Uruba police station, which also took sniper fire, but neither resulted in
casualties.

The police became vigilant, and they apprehended a shady-looking man skulking around near the al-
Hadaeg police station, finding him to have two rocket propelled grenades in his possession, which he
was apparently intending to fire at the station.
In other words, the capture of Libyan Deep Throat has set off a gang war on the police, who are being
informed by bombings and shootings that they must let their informant go or risk their
So what is Deep Throat saying? According to local journalist Mohamed Bujenah of the Libyan Herald,
a senior figure in the Benghazi police told him that the informant had fingered as many as 7
prominent Muslim fundamentalist leaders in connection with these attacks, of whom the police
named 6 explicitly:
1 Sufyan Ben Qumu, from the notoriously radical town of Derna, and a former prisoner at
Guantanamo
2.Ahmad Bukatela, leader of the ',Thai& Militia
3.Muhammad al-Zahawi, head of the Ansar al-Sharia militia
4.Muhammad al-Gharabi, a leader of the Rafallala al-Sahati Militia
5.Ismail Sallabi, another leader of Rafallah al-Sahati
6.Salim .Nabous, head of the Zawiya Martyrs' Brigade
It is just a newspaper article. We don't know if the informant actually named these individuals or if he
did so to escape torture, in which case we can't trust what he said. But if the allegations are true, there
is collusion among several hardline militias in the city to create instability in hopes of taking it over.
The new, elected, prime minister Ali Zeidan, has started asserting himself militarily. He closed the
country's southern borders against instability in the Sahel. He may well have some risky house
cleaning to do in Benghazi.

certainly has a lot of responsibility for what happened in Benghazi. That's -- that report made that very

Re: Libya internal strife
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the highest levels of
European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1. On the evening of January 22, 2012, according to an official with access to the leadership of the National
Transitional Government (NTC), Libyan President Mustafa Abdul Jalil spoke at length with Prime Minister Abdurrahim el-
Keib, stating in a heated exchange that el-Keib's government must take the steps necessary to address the complaints of
the demobilized fighters from the 2011revolution. Jalil pointed out that the new government has been discussing this
situation since it was formed in October 2011, and matters have now reached a crisis point with a group of more than
2,000 disgruntled veterans, supported by students, attacking the NTC offices in Benghazi on January 21, destroying
computer equipment and NTC files. These demonstrators, some of whom threw Molotov cocktails at the NTC
headquarters building, continue to demand better medical care, jobs, payment for their time in the revolutionary army, and
a commitment to transparency on the part of the el-Keib regime; particularly the appointment of cabinet members arid
senior officials.
2. According to this source, when el-Keib replied, pointing out that demonstrators were camped outside of his
office in Tripoli. He added that the government had to proceed in a measured and professional manner, Jalil stated in
angry tones, that NTC Staffers were beaten and could have been killed during the January 21 incident, pointing out that
this is how the rebellion against Muammar al Qaddafi began in February 2011. Jalil also warned that Islamist leader
General Abdel Hakim Alamin Belhaj and his supporters, particularly militia commanders from Zintan, Misrata, and other

western regions, are anxiously waiting for the NTC government to collapse. Their goal, in the opinion of this individual, is
to eventually move in and establish a strict Islamic state. Jalil, added that his contacts in the Egyptian Muslim
Brotherhood had been in touch during the preceding week, warning that the threat from Belhaj is very real. El-Keib stated
that he must press Minister of Defense Osama al-Juwali and Interior Minister Fawzi Abd Ali to be more efficient in
administering their positions. According to this individual, el-Keib fears that al-Juwali, who was a western commander
during the revolution, may be maintaining a secret relationship with Belhaj and his allies. In response, Jai warned el-Keib
to avoid trying to use the regular military forces posted around Benghazi under General Khalifa Beloasim Hefter in an
effort to restrain the former militia troops as such a step could lead to civil war.
3.(Source Comment: In the opinion of an extremely well placed individual, el-Keib is, in fact, increasingly
frustrated by the inefficiency in his regime and the inability of hie ministers and administrators to arrange contracts with
foreign firms. He complains that his principal advisors, Minister of Oil Abdulrahman Ben Yezza and Minister of Finance
Hassan Zigiam, have been too timid in resolving the questions associated with contracts involving foreign firms, both old
and new. At present it appearsthat whenever one official raises a question regarding an agreement the entire matter is
put on hold and delayed. In the opinion of this source, el-Kelb knows that without these agreements he cannot meet the
demands of the veterans and the students. El-Keib stated in confidence, that he may have made a serious mistake in
removing the former oil/finance minister All Tatham' from the government. El-Kelb also noted that Jalil is shaken by the
January 21 attack on NTC headquarters end is searching for ways to appease the demonstrators. Most recently he
asked Abdel - Haltdh Ghoza, his principal deputy and NiC spokesman to step down. Ghoza, who comes from the
Benghazi area, was particularly unpopular with the western troops.)
4. Following the discussion with Jalil, el-Kieb ordered Ziglarn and Ngeb Obedoi, the head of the Stock Exchange,
to move with all possible speed to address the issue of the foreign contracts and arrange for new vendors to provide the
services demanded by the veterans and students. In this discussion he pointed out that if they cannot deal with this
situation they will not have to worry about the national elections in 2012, Libya will be an Islamic Republic, with BeMO as
the ruler. El-Kalb pointed out that foreign governments and large oil firms must be aware of this threat and that this will
frighten them into meeting the conditions for foreign contracts set out by the NTC.
5. (Source Comment: According to an extremely sensitive source, el-Keib spoke secretly with Hefter, stating that
he, and those troops loyal to him, should be prepared to move to protect the government in the event of increased
violence. This effort could include moving against Belhaj and attacking militia forces before they can unite and
organize. El-Keib emphasized that this is for planning purposes only, and no action should be taken until el-Kelb gives
the order. He emphasized that he will do everything possible to avoid civil war, but he is now concerned that Jai will be
unable to deal with the level of hostility against the NTC, and cannot be counted on to take strong positions against Belhaj
and his supporters. In the opinion of this individual, el-Keib cannot back away from his commitment to technicians in
senior positions, but he will press them as hard as he can to have the government respond to the needs of the veterans
and students. El-Keib believes it is not too late to address these problems, but they must move quickly.)

VAN SUSTEREN: Senator, there is a report from the State Department that Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton will testify on Benghazi before the middle of January. There has been some criticism of whether or
not she has a concussion. I believe she has a concussion. What do you think?
MCCAIN: I know that in my view, Secretary Clinton, when she said she assumed full responsibility, she
certainly has a lot of responsibility for what happened in Benghazi. That's -- that report made that very
clear. But I must say, ,I have never seen Secretary Clinton back down from a fight And I have
never seen her back down. And I believe that she is now not physically well enough to testify
and she will testify the middle of 3anuary.

The Benghazi protestors appear to
be a pastiche of different groups of disaffected people including war-wounded, martyrs' families, transparency and
accountability demendeurs, and those who believe the east is once again being neglected. So the source of this report
attributing the whole thing to war-wounded does not jive, although they may have been the ones who carried out
the violent acts. The Belhaj bogeyman is a bit overplayed-no doubt his military influence has waned but he does remain
a player â€”one of many â€”looking to make political gain in this new environment The proposition that he is just lying in
waiting to take advantage of the current stability to move in and establish an Islamic state appears a bit
exaggerated. Minister of Labor Rajbani (who has his own axes to grind) said there is now a group of six ministers (I need
to clarify whether this is with al-Keeb's knowelcige or not) who are serving as the ""cohones"" of the cabinet and taking
decisions the others won't al-Keeb Is proceding cautiously (that is his strength and weakness) and that is the problem-
this is really the time for a ""war-time"" cabinet not the cautious approach he appears to be taking does not suit this volatile
time Let's see what the meeting today between the NTC and the government producesâ€”the benghazi protests, the Bani
Walid conflict and the various other incidents that have flared up in recent days point to the need for some real drastic
movement in the DDR process and in the other issues that engender current dissatisfaction among the populace. I can
really comment on the points regarding foreign contracts except to say it rings true given the current governments
reluctance to make any significant decisions, especially regarding past or future issues of money. The Hefter piece also
sounds a bridge too far given al-Keeb's disposition. But I do agree that it is not too late if this government can just
organize itself and take some fundamental decisions to i mprove liquidity, get the real war-wounded good treatment and
push the MOD and MOI to speed up the DDR process.

a commitment to transparency on the part of the el-Keib regime; particularly the appointment of cabinet members and
senior officials.
2. According to this source, when el-Keib replied, pointing out that demonstrators were camped outside of his
office in Tripoli. He added that the government had to proceed in a measured and professional manner, Jalil stated in
angry tones, that NTC staffers were beaten and could have been killed during the January 21 incident, pointing out that
this is how the rebellion against Muammar al Qaddafi began in February 2011, Jaill also warned that Islamist leader
General Abdel Hakim Alamin Belhaj and his supporters, particularly militia commanders from Zintan, Misrata, and other
western regions, are anxiously waiting for the NTC government to collapse. Their goal, in the opinion of this individual, is
to eventually move in and establish a strict Islamic state. Jan!, added that his contacts in the Egyptian Muslim
Brotherhood had been in touch during the preceding week, warning that the threat from Belhaj is very real. El-Keib stated
that he must press Minister of Defense Osama al-Juwali and Interior Minister Fawzi Abd All to be more efficient in
administering their positions. According to this individual, el-Keib fears that al-Juwali, who was a western commander
during the revolution, may be maintaining a secret relationship with Belhaj and his allies. In response, Jalil warned el-Keib
to avoid trying to use the regular military forces posted around Benghazi under General Khalifs Belqasim Hefter in an
effort to restrain the former militia troops as such a step could lead to civil war.
3. (Source Comment In the opinion of an extremely well placed individual, el-Keib is, in fact, increasingly
frustrated by the inefficiency in his regime and the Inability of his ministers and administrators to arrange contracts with
foreign firms. He complains that his principal advisors, Minister of Oil Abdulrahman Ben Yezza and Minister of Finance
Hassan Ziglam, have been too timid in resolving the questions associated with contracts involving foreign firms, both old
and new. At present it appears that whenever one official raises a question regarding an agreement the entire matter is
put on hold and delayed. In the opinion of this source, el-Keib knows that without these agreements he cannot meet the
demands of the veterans and the students. El-Keib stated in confidence, that he may have made a serious mistake in
removing the former oil/finance minister Ali Tarhouni from the government. El-Keib also noted that JalIl is shaken by the
January 21 attack on NTC headquarters and is searching for ways to appease the demonstrators. Most recently he
asked Abdel â€” Hafidh Ghoza, his principal deputy and NTC spokesman to step down. Ghoza, who comes from the
Benghazi area, was particularly unpopular with the western troops.)
4. Following the discussion with Jalil, el-Kieb ordered Ziglam and Ngeb Obeda, the head of the Stock Exchange,
to move with all possible speed to address the issue of the foreign contracts and arrange for new vendors to provide the
services demanded by the veterans and students. In this discussion he pointed out that if they cannot deal with this
situation they will not have to worry about the national elections in 2012, Libya will be an Islamic Republic, with Belhaj as
the ruler. El-Keib pointed out that foreign governments and large oil firms must be aware of this threat and that this will
frighten them into meeting the conditions for foreign contracts set out by the NTC.
5. (Source Comment According to an extremely sensitive source, el-Keib spoke secretly with Haftar, stating that
he, and those troops loyal to him, should be prepared to move to protect the government in the event of increased
violence. This effort could include moving against Belhaj and attacking militia forces before they can unite and
organize. El-Keib emphasized that this is for planning purposes only, and no action should be taken until el-Keib gives
the order. He emphasized that he will do everything possible to avoid civil war, but he is now concerned that Jalil will be
unable to deal with the level of hostility against the NTC, and cannot be counted on to take strong positions against Belhaj
and his supporters. In the opinion of this individual, el-Keib cannot back away from his commitment to technicians in
senior positions, but he will press them as hard as he can to have the government respond to the needs of the veterans
and students. El-Keib believes it is not too late to address these problems, but they must move quickly.)

Benghazi's Deep Throat fingers Islamist Leaders for
Attacks as State Dept Criticized on Consular Security
Posted on 12/19/2012 by Juan
The report saying that security was inadequate at the compound that the US had adopted as its ad hoc
consulate in Benghazi, Libya, dominates today's headlines. That conclusion is obvious. The
""consulate"" was just a private residence taken over for this purpose by the US in the city. It was not
constructed to be a US government building in a potentially hostile city.
I met a person who worked there when I was in Benghazi in June, and she told me that it wasn't even
clear if the consulate would be retained after the first of this year. It was possibly temporary,
depending on Congressional funding. (The Tea Party House hasn't been good on meeting requests for
embassy security funds).
The more interesting question than why ad hoc arrangements should have been made for a consulate
during and after the Libyan revolution (the answer to which seems fairly obvious) is, who is
responsible for the string of assassinations and acts of violence in the city, of which the RPG attack on
the consulate on September 11 was only one? Benghazi, with a population of over one million in a
country of 6.5 million, is Libya's second largest city and was the epicenter of the revolution against the
government of Muammar Qaddafi in 2011.
On November 22, Benghazi police chief Farej Darssi was assassinated. In October a police colonel
barely avoided deathâ€” his car was wired to explode. A Libyan intelligence officer was killed in
September. A general was assassinated in August. Some of these figures had worked for Qaddafi but
had defected to the revolution. Qaddafi's security forces were responsible for the 1996 massacre of
hardline fundamentalists at Abu Salim prison, and for making others just disappear. Likely the same
shadowy cells that attacked the US consulate are behind the attacks on Benghazi police and army
officers.
There may have been a break in the case. Last Saturday, Benghazi security forces loyal to the elected
government in Tripoli, captured a man they suspected of being involved with the groups behind the
violence. And, he appears to have been willing to spill the beans. So let's call him the Libyan Deep
Throat.
Deep Throat is so knowledgeable about the conspiracies facing the city and so dangerous to those
hatching them that the latter immediately attempted to spring him from jail.

On Sunday morning, militants attacked the police facility next to the holding cell where the man is
being detained. A policeman at that station died in a hail of bullets from the attackers, and they called
for back-up. The police car that sped to the scene was ambushed and three policemen in it were killed.
Still, the police stood their ground and fought off the assault, and they kept their valuable suspect in
custody, with all his valuable testimony.
Shortly after midnight, on Monday morning, small explosives were set off at the Garyounis police
station in Benghazi, damaging a couple of automobiles but otherwise doing little damage. Then
explosives were set off at al-Uruba police station, which also took sniper fire, but neither resulted in
casualties.
The police became vigilant, and they apprehended a shady-looking man skulking around near the al-
Hadaeg police station, finding him to have two rocket propelled grenades in his possession, which he
was apparently intending to fire at the station.
In other words, the capture of Libyan Deep Throat has set off a gang war on the police, who are being
informed by bombings and shootings that they must let their infounant go or risk their
So what is Deep Throat saying? According to local journalist Mohamed Bujenah of the Libyan Herald,
a senior figure in the Benghazi police told him that the informant had fingered as many as 7
prominent Muslim fundamentalist leaders in connection with these attacks, of whom the police
named 6 explicitly:
1 Sayan Ben Quinu, from the notoriously radical town of Derna, and a former prisoner at
Guantanamo
2.Ahmad Bukatela, leader of the Mai& Militia
3.Muhammad al-Zahawi, head of the Ansar al-Sharia militia
4.Muhammad al-Gharabi, a leader of the Rafallah al-Sahafi Militia
5.Ismail Sallabi, another leader of Rafallah al-Sahati
6.Salim Nabous, head of the Zawiya Martyrs' Brigade
It is just a newspaper article. We don't kilow if the informant actually named these individuals or if he
did so to escape torture, in which case we can't trust what he said. But if the allegations are true, there
is collusion among several hardline militias in the city to create instability in hopes of taking it over.
The new, elected, prime minister Ali Zeidan, has started asserting himself militarily. He clod the
country's southern borders against instability in the Sahel. He may well have some risky house
cleaning to do in Benghazi.

camped outside of his office in Tripoli. He added that the government had to proceed in a
measured and professional manner, Jalil stated in angry tones, that NTC staffers were beaten and
could have been killed during the January 21 incident, pointing out that this is how the rebellion
against Muammar al Qaddafi began in February 2011. Jalil also warned that Islamist leader
General Abdel Hakim Alamin Belhaj and his supporters, particularly militia commanders from
Zintan, Misrata, and other western regions, are anxiously waiting for the NTC government to
collapse. Their goal, in the opinion of this individual, is to eventually move in and establish a
strict Islamic state. Jalil, added that his contacts in the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood had been
in touch during the preceding week, warning that the threat from Belhaj is very real. El-Keib

stated that he must press Minister of Defense Osama al-Juwali and Interior Minister Fawzi Abd
Ali to be more efficient in administering their positions. According to this individual, el-Keib
fears that al-Juwali, who was a western commander during the revolution, may be maintaining a
secret relationship with Belhaj and his allies In response, Jalil warned el-Keib to avoid trying to
use the regular military forces posted around Benghazi under General Khalifa Belqasim Haftar in
an effort to restrain the former militia troops as such a step could lead to civil war.
3.(Source Comment: In the opinion of an extremely well placed individual, el-Keib is,
in fact, increasingly frustrated by the inefficiency in his regime and the inability of his ministers
and administrators to arrange contracts with foreign firms. He complains that his principal
advisors, Minister of Oil Abdulrahman Ben Yezza and Minister of Finance Hassan Ziglam, have
been too timid in resolving the questions associated with contracts involving foreign firms, both
old and new. At present it appears that whenever one official raises a question regarding an
agreement the entire matter is put on hold and delayed. In the opinion of this source, el-Keib
knows that without these agreements he cannot meet the demands of the veterans and the
students. El-Keib stated in confidence, that he may have made a serious mistake in removing the
former oil/finance minister Ali Tarhouni from the government. El-Keib also noted that Jalil is
shaken by the January 21 attack on NTC headquarters and is searching for ways to appease the
demonstrators. Most recently he asked Abdel â€” Hafidh Ghoza, his principal deputy and NTC
spokesman to step down. Ghoza, who comes from the Benghazi area, was particularly
unpopular with the western troops.)
4. Following the discussion with Jalil, el-Kieb ordered Ziglam and Ngeb Obeda, the head
of the Stock Exchange, to move with all possible speed to address the issue of the foreign
contracts and arrange for new vendors to provide the services demanded by the veterans and
students. In this discussion he pointed out that if they cannot deal with this situation they will
not have to worry about the national elections in 2012, Libya will be an Islamic Republic, with
Belhaj as the ruler. El-Keib pointed out that foreign governments and large oil firms must be
aware of this threat and that this will frighten them into meeting the conditions for foreign
contracts set out by the NTC.
5. (Source Comment: According to an extremely sensitive source, el-Keib spoke
secretly with Haftar, stating that he, and those troops loyal to him, should be prepared to move to
protect the government in the event of increased violence. This effort could include moving
against Belhaj and attacking militia forces before they can unite and organize. El-Keib
emphasized that this is for planning purposes only, and no action should be taken until el-Keib
gives the order. He emphasized that he will do everything possible to avoid civil war, but he is
now concerned that Jalil will be unable to deal with the level of hostility against the NTC, and
cannot be counted on to take strong positions against Belhaj and his supporters. In the opinion of
this individual, el-Keib cannot back away from his commitment to technicians in senior
positions, but he will press them as hard as he can to have the government respond to the needs

Benghazi's Deep Throat fingers Islamist Leaders for
Attacks as State Dept Criticized on Consular Security
Posted on 12/19/2012 by Juan
The report saying that security was inadequate at the compound that the US had adopted as its ad hoc
consulate in Benghazi, Libya, dominates today's headlines. That conclusion is obvious. The
""consulate"" was just a private residence taken over for this purpose by the US in the city. It was not
constructed to be a US government building in a potentially hostile city.
I met a person who worked there when I was in Benghazi in June, and she told me that it wasn't even
clear if the consulate would be retained after the first of this year It was possibly temporary,
depending on Congressional funding. (The Tea Party House hasn't been good on meeting requests for
embassy security funds).
The more interesting question than why ad hoc arrangements should have been made for a consulate
during and after the Libyan revolution (the answer to which seems fairly obvious) is, who is
responsible for the string of assassinations and acts of violence in the city, of which the RPG attack on
the consulate on September 11 was only one? Benghazi, with a population of over one million in a
country of 6.5 million, is Libya's second largest city and was the epicenter of the revolution against the
government of Muammar Qaddafi in 2011.
On November 22, Benghazi police chief Farej Darssi was assassinated. In October a police colonel
barely avoided deathâ€” his car was wired to explode. A Libyan intelligence officer was killed in
September. A general was assassinated in August. Some of these figures had worked for Qaddafi but
had defected to the revolution. QacIdafi's security forces were responsible for the 1996 massacre of
hardline fundamentalists at Abu Salim prison, and for making others just disappear. Likely the same
shadowy cells that attacked the US consulate are behind the attacks on Benghazi police and army
officers.
There may have been a break in the case. Last Saturday, Benghazi securiV forces loyal to the elected
government in Tripoli, captured a man they suspected of being involved with the groups behind the

violence.And, he appears to have been willing to spill the beans. So let's call him the Libyan Deep
Throat.
Deep Throat is so knowledgeable about the conspiracies facing the city and so dangerous to those
hatching them that the latter immediately attempted to spring him from jail.
On Sunday morning, militants attacked the police facility next to the holding cell where the man is
being detained. A policeman at that station died in a hail of bullets from the attackers, and they called
for back-up. The police ear that sped to the scene was ambushed and three policemen in it were killed.
Still, the police stood their ground and fought off the assault, and they kept their valuable suspect in
custody, with all his valuable testimony.
Shortly after midnight, on Monday morning, small explosives were set off at the Garyounis police
station in Benghazi, damaging a couple of automobiles but otherwise doing little damage. Then
explosives were set off at al-Uruba pollee station, which also took sniper fire, but neither resulted in
casualties.
The police became vigilant, and they apprehended a shady-looking man skulking around near the al-
Hadaeg police station, finding him to have two rocket propelled grenades in his possession, which he
was apparently intending to fire at the station.
In other words, the capture of Libyan Deep Throat has set off a gang war on the police, who are being
informed by bombings and shootings that they must let their informant go or risk their
So what is Deep Throat saying? According to local journalist Mohamed Bujenah of the Libyan Herald,
a senior figure in the Benghazi police told him that the informant had fingered as many as 7
prominent Muslim fundamentalist leaders in connection with these attacks, of whom the police
named 6 explicitly:
Sufyan Ben Qumu, from the notoriously radical town of Duna, and a former prisoner at
Guantanamo
2.Ahmad Bukatela, leader of the Ubaida Militia
3.Muhammad al-Zahawi, head of the Ansar al-Sharia militia
4. Muhammad al-Gharabi, a leader of the Rafallah al-Sahati Militia
5.Ismail Sallabi, another leader of Rafallah al-Sahati
6.Salim Nabotes, head of the Zawiya Martyrs' Brigade
It is just a newspaper article. We don't know if the informant actually named these individuals or if he
did so to escape torture, in which case we can't trust what he said. But if the allegations are true, there
is collusion among several hardline militias in the city to create instability in hopes of taking it over.
The new, elected, prime minister All Zeidan, has started asserting himself militarily. He closed the
country's southern borders against instability in the Sahel. He may well have some risky house
cleaning to do in Benghazi.

1. On February 19, 2012, Libyan President Mustafa Abdul Jalil and Prime
Minister Abdurrahim el-Keib instructed Minister of the Interior Minister Favvzi Abd All
and Minister of Defense Osama al Juwali to move as forcefully as possible to deal with
armed conflict between the various militias which carried the bulk of fighting during the
2onrevolution against former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi. According to an
extremely sensitive source speaking in secret, el-Keib, acting in his role as the head of
government, told the two ministers that, if they could not stop the fighting and disarm
the militias he would be forced to find ministers who can cally out his orders. Ali and
Juwali each stated privately that, while they would follow orders, they have little hope of
succeeding in this matter until el-Keib and Jail gain credibility as the rulers of the
country. Ali added that, in his opinion, this situation will persist until a new

2. In the opinion of this individual, the Prime Minister is particularly concerned
by the situation in the Southern portion of the country, where the area defined by the
towns of Ghat, Sabha, and al Kufra, where fighting between rival tribal and regional
militias has been exacerbated by the activities of Qaddafi loyalists, and their allies,
Taureg tribal fighters. This individual added that el-Keib and Jalil agree that the
uncertain security situation in this area represents a threat to Libya's future stability.
They agreed that, at present, if faced with a concerted effort by either disaffected
militiamen or pro-Qaddafi forces government security forces and the new national army
would be unable to protect either Libyan citizens or Western businessmen and oil
industry workers in the region.
3.(Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, el-Keib believes that any
attack against oil field workers will frighten large Western firms and seriously damage
Libya's efforts to recover from the revolution. This individual added that al Juwali is
particularly upset with his deputy Minister and Chief of Staff of the Army, General
Yousef Mangoush, who he believes has been unable to work with national army ground
force commander General Khalifa Belgasim Haftar. A very sensitive source added that
the Benghazi based units of the army, under Haftar's direct command, are currently
deploying to the area southeast of al-Kufra, along the Sudanese border.)
4. In the opinion of a sensitive source, Haftar and al Juwali believe that the
Sudanese military is providing arms and supplies to the pro-Qaddafi forces, under direct
orders from Sudanese President Omar al Bashir. El-Keib complained to al-Juwali that
Haftar's forces passed through al-Kufra region during early and mid-February on their
way to the Sudanese border, however; they did nothing to disarm the local revolutionary
militias, or stop the fighting between competing tribal groups. In the opinion of this
individual, Rafter felt that the threat from the pro-Qaddafi forces was greater than that
posed by the regional and tribal fighting
5. At the same time, a source with excellent access to the leadership of the
National Transitional Council (NTC) stated in secret that fighting continues between
regional, tribal, and religious rivals throughout the Northern/Mediterranean portions of
the country. This same source added that the ongoing struggle between the Misrata and
Zintan militias for control of the area west of Tripoli is particularly violent and
disruptive for the rest of the country. In the capital itself, fighting continues between
regional groups, the national army, Islamist militias, and criminal street gangs, all of
whom are very well armed. This individual reports that during mid -February 2012 el-
Keib and Jalil agreed to address the problem of disaffected former militiamen and their
families by providing payments of 2,000 Dinars (approximately $1,500) per month to
the families of fighters who were wounded or killed in the revolution.
6. In addition the President and Prime Minister instructed Minister of Finance
Hassan Ziglam to develop an efficient system to provide assistance funds to unemployed
former fighters. For his part, Ziglam privately expressed concern that previous efforts in
this regard have met with a high level of fraud. According to the government's best
estimates, the revolutionary army included approximately 25,000 combat troops, but it
is difficult to identify those with legitimate claims, as no accurate service records were
maintained. That said, he stated in private that the government must be seen to take
some form of direct action, even if money is paid to fraudulent claimants. The fact is,
according to Ziglam, the NTC is losing control of the country and must give something
to the veterans of the revolution to slow this process.
7.(Source Comment: Speaking in strictest confidence, a knowledgeable
individual stated that al-Juwali is concerned by the possibility that the country may
deteriorate into a multi-sided civil war involving the regional militias, Islamist forces
and the national army. At the same time, he acknowledges that the new army has lost
control of large portions of the southern part of the country, with tribal fighting spilling

slow pace of military and police training promised to the various Libyan national

It is with profound sadness that I share the news of the death of four American personnel, in Benghazi, Libya yesterday.
Among them were United States Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and Foreign Service Information Management
Officer, Sean Smith. We are still making next of kin notifications for the other two individuals. Our hearts go out to all
their families and colleagues.
A 23. year veteran of the Foreign Service, Ambassador Stevens died last night from injuries he sustained in the attack on
our office in Benghazi.
I had the privilege of swearing in Chris for his post in Libya only a few months ago. He spoke eloquently about his
passion for service, for diplomacy and for the Libyan people. This assignment was only the latest in his more than two
decades of dedication to advancing closer ties with the people of the Middle East and North Africa which began as a
Peace Corps Volunteer in Morocco. As the conflict in Libya unfolded, Chris was one of the first Americans on the ground
in Benghazi. He risked his own life to lend the Libyan people a helping hand to build the foundation for a new, free
nation. He spent every day since helping to finish the work that he started. Chris was committed to advancing America's
values and interests, even when that meant putting himself in danger.
Sean was a husband and a father of two, who joined the Department ten
years ago. Like Chris, Sean was one of our best. All the Americans
we lost in yesterday's attacks made the ultimate sacrifice. We condemn this vicious and violent attack that took their
lives, which they had committed to helping the Libyan people reach for a better future.
America's diplomats and development experts stand on the front lines every day for our country. We are honored by
the service of each and every one of them.

of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
a. During early December 2012 Libyan Prime Minister Ali Zidan and President Mohamed
Magariaf concluded a series of discreet meetings with selected tribal leaders from Eastern Cyrenaica
region (Barqa in Arabic), after which they agreed that the problem of the growing Barqa federalist
movement is gaining strength and will again become a major issue in early 2013. At the same time
National Libyan Army (NLA) Chief of Staff General Youssef al Mangoush warned Zidan that the
Eastern tribes have rearmed and reequipped in the past three months and are preparing to reassert
their desire for a degree of autonomy in early 2013. Mangoush also advised that the situation in the
region between Benghazi and the Egyptian border may become increasingly complicated as Salafist
fighters from Egypt continue to arrive in Benghazi. Mangoush reported that his staff officers have
been advised M secret by aids to Egyptian Army Chief of Staff, General Mohammed al-Sissi, that,
acting under instructions from Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi, military and security forces are
taking steps to detain or neutralize extreme Salafist para-military groups and that a number of these
fighters are fleeing to Libya. According to the Libyan commander, these Salafist fighters are
comfortable in Benghazi, where many of them served with Libyan revolutionary forces during the
rebellion against former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi.

2. In the opinion of this individual, Zidan and Magariaf, after consulting with Minister of Oil
Abdulbari al-Arusi, decided to move forward with a plan dating back to the administration of former
Oil Minister Abdulrahman Ben Yezza dividing the National Oil Corporatioes (NOC) production and
exploration divisions into two separate firms. With this in mind, al-Arusi began discussing the matter
with concerned parties in late November and early December. Included in these discussions were
meetings with members of the local federalist council in Benghazi and tribal officials from Barqa. In
these sessions Al-Arusi described a new structure managing all existing oil-related firmsâ€ž while
building new operations and raising funds from investors outside of the country. This firm will be
divided into two branches, one in Benghazi and one in Tripoli. Al-Arusi added that the cost of this
project will range between fifty (50) and sixty (6o) billion dinars.
3.(Source Comment: According to a separate sensitive source, this concept came as a surprise
to most of the local officials in Tripoli and Benghazi. This individual added that while the Western
officials continue to have some questions about the matter, the Benghazi/Barqa leaders were, in al-
Arusi's opinion, positive, if not enthusiastic about the new initiative. According to al-Arusi, doubts on
either side relate to the mistrust that remains between the two regions, but he is determined to move
ahead in this matter and is supported by Zidan and Magariaf. According to this source, the president
and prime minister are convinced that they must deal with this internal East-West issue before they
can bring a stable security environment to the country, and disarm the remaining independent
militias in each part of the country. This individual added that in private discussions al-Arusi stated
that the tentative name for this new oil entity will be the National Corporation for Oil Refining and
Petrochemicals Industry, with its headquarters in Tripoli, and substantive offices in Benghazi. Like
the NOC, the new firm will fall under the Ministry of Oil and Gas.)
4. In addition, this sensitive source noted that Al-Arusi is also discussing the creation of a
company specializing in mechanical construction related to the oil and gas industry. This firm would
be based in Benghazi. The minister stated in private that he believes such a company can be
developed to compete with international firms in this very complex field. He also believes that such a
firm must be managed by experienced, scientifically-qualified Libyans, with reputations for honesty.
He noted that until as such a cadre is developed it may be desirable to use experts from Egypt to fill
the immediate needs of the firm. Al-Arusi believes this firm should have offices in all of the oil fields
and loading facilities. The minister also plans to establish an office in Benghazi, similar to Tripoli's oil
institute, a facility that will train students looking to pursue oil-related studies. In addition, al-Arusi is
making plans to reopen the Higher Petroleum Institute in Tobruk, which was closed by Qaddafi at the
beginning of the revolution. He told a sensitive source that he expects the Tobruk institute to produce
thousands of skilled engineers to provide Libyan managers for the future operation of the oil sector.
Once the final details are set the Zidan regime will submit the entire package for parliamentary
approval and financing
6. (Source Comment: Advisors to Magariaf state in confidence that, in their opinion this
comprehensive plan for the oil industry will face opposition from individuals with links to foreign oil
firms, primarily foreign trained engineers who hope to see greater privatization in the oil an oil
services industries in the wake of the revolution. According to a particularly sensitive source, Zidan is
particularly concerned about this possibility, noting that these individuals see this issue in strictly
business terms, not considering the political issues, and the East â€” West situation, that are all part of
the overall picture in Libya. At present al-Arusi believes that foreign oil firms remain concerned
about the unsettled security situation throughout Libya, however; he is convinced that this new plan
will help address this situation. At present, he noted that the large Italian oil firm ENT is stepping up
its operations throughout Libya, and, with the support of the Italian Government, will continue to
increase its investment in Libya in an effort to get ahead of the other foreign firms concerned in
Libya.)

Re: Libya politics to control militias
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as
well as the highest levels of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and
security services.
1. On February 19, 2012, Libyan President Ylustafa Abdul Mil and Prime
Minister Abdurrahim el-Keib instructed Minister of the Interior Minister Fawzi Abd Ali
and Minister of Defense Osama al Juwali to move as forcefully as possible to deal with
armed conflict between the various militias which carried the bulk of fighting during the
20nrevolution against former dictator Muammar al Qaddafl. According to an

extremely sensitive source speaking in secret, el-Keib, acting in his role as the head of
government, told the two ministers that, if they could not stop the fighting and disarm
the militias he would be forced to find ministers who can carry out his orders. Ali and
Juwali each stated privately that, while they would follow orders, they have little hope of
succeeding in this matter until el-Keib and Jalil gain credibility as the rulers of the
country. Ali added that, in his opinion, this situation will persist until a new
government is chosen during the national elections planned for later in 2012.
2. In the opinion of this individual, the Prime Minister is particularly concerned
by the situation in the Southern portion of the country, where the area defined by the
towns of Ghat, Sabha, and al Kufra, where fighting between rival tribal and regional
militias has been exacerbated by the activities of Qaddafi loyalists, and their allies,
Taureg tribal fighters. This individual added that el-Keib and Jalil agree that the
uncertain security situation in this area represents a threat to Libya's future stability.
They agreed that, at present, if faced with a concerted effort by either disaffected
militiamen or pro-Qaddafi forces government security forces and the new national army
would be unable to protect either Libyan citizens or Western businessmen and oil
industry workers in the region.
3.(Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, el-Keib believes that any
attack against oil field workers will frighten large Western firms and seriously damage
Libya's efforts to recover from the revolution. This individual added that al Juwali is
particularly upset with his deputy Minister and Chief of Staff of the Army, General
Yousef Mangoush, who he believes has been unable to work with national army ground
force commander General Khalifa Belqasim Haftar. A very sensitive source added that
the Benghazi based units of the army, under Haftar's direct command, are currently
deploying to the area southeast of al-Kufra, along the Sudanese border.)
4. In the opinion of a sensitive source, Haftar and al Juwali believe that the
Sudanese military is providing arms and supplies to the pro-Qaddafi forces, under direct
orders from Sudanese President Omar al Bashir. El-Keib complained to al-Juwali that
Haftar's forces passed through al-Kufra region during early and mid-February on their
way to the Sudanese border, however; they did nothing to disarm the local revolutionary
militias, or stop the fighting between competing tribal groups. In the opinion of this
individual, Hafter felt that the threat from the pro-Qaddafi forces was greater than that
posed by the regional and tribal fighting.
5. At the same time, a source with excellent access to the leadership of the
National Transitional Council (NTC) stated in secret that fighting continues between
regional, tribal, and religious rivals throughout the Northern/Mediterranean portions of
the country. This same source added that the ongoing struggle between the Misrata and
Zintan militias for control of the area west of Tripoli is particularly violent and
disruptive for the rest of the country. In the capital itself, fighting continues between
regional groups, the national army, Islamist militias, and criminal street gangs, all of
whom are very well armed. This individual reports that during mid-February 2012 el-
Keib and Jalil agreed to address the problem of disaffected former militiamen and their
families by providing payments of 2,000 Dinars (approximately $1,500) per month to
the families of fighters who were wounded or killed in the revolution.
6. In addition the President and Prime Minister instructed Minister of Finance
Hassan Ziglam to develop an efficient system to provide assistance funds to unemployed
former fighters. For his part, Ziglam privately expressed concern that previous efforts in
this regard have met with a high level of fraud. According to the government's best
estimates, the revolutionary army included approximately 25,000 combat troops, but it
is difficult to identify those with legitimate claims, as no accurate service records were
maintained. That said, he stated in private that the government must be seen to take
some form of direct action, even if money is paid to fraudulent claimants. The fact is,

according to Ziglam, the NTC is losing control of the country and must give something
to the veterans of the revolution to slow this process.
7.(Source Comment: Speaking in strictest confidence, a knowledgeable
individual stated that al-Juwali is concerned by the possibility that the country may
deteriorate into a multi-sided civil war involving the regional militias, Islamist forces
and the national army. At the same time, he acknowledges that the new army has lost
control of large portions of the southern part of the country, with tribal fighting spilling
over into Mali and Chad. According to this source, al-Juwali is also frustrated by the
slow pace of military and police training promised to the various Libyan national
security forces by the governments of France and Turkey. He added that, while Turkey
has received some of the most seriously wound troops for treatment, the lack of
adequate medical care for veterans inside of Libya remains a major source of conflict
between the former rebel troops and the N'TC government)

THE SECRETARY OF STATE
WASHINGTON
Dear Colleagues â€”
I wanted to reach out to you directly after this challenging week, and express my gratitude for everything you
do to advance our nation's interests and values. That is how we keep faith with those we serve and honor
those we've lost. Even after four years, I continue to be amazed by your dedication, energy, and talent. It is a
privilege to be part of your team.
I also want to thank everyone who is working so hard to provide all our people and posts with the best
possible leadership, security and support. As Deputy Secretaries Burns and Nides told Congress on Thursday,
our colleagues in Diplomatic Security, Near Eastern Affairs, and in every bureau across the Department, at
home and abroad, get it right countless times a day, for years on end, in some of the toughest circumstances
imaginable. We need to learn from the tragedy in Benghazi, and make every possible improvement -- and we
will. We also need to recognize the extraordinary service of our security professionals. They are courageous
patriots and consummate professionals. And like you, I trust them with my life.
I want to thank Ambassador Pickering, Admiral Mullen, and all the members of the Accountability Review
Board. Their report takes a clear-eyed look at serious and systemic problems that we are already working to
fix. I have accepted every one of the Board's recommendations. I asked the Deputy Secretary for
Management and Resources to spearhead the effort to implement them, and to take those additional steps
above and beyond those recommendations that make sense and make us stronger. To do this well, we need
your help. All of us have to work together to take these reforms to heart and build on and improve the way
we do business.
I am determined to leave the State Department and USAID stronger, safer, and more secure than I found
them. I owe that to each of you. And I am delighted that President Obama has chosen Senator John Kerry to
continue that work. Earlier today, I spoke with John and congratulated him on his nomination to be the next
Secretary of State. I have been privileged to know him for many years, and to call him a friend, colleague, and
partner. He is the son of a career Foreign Service Officer, a decorated war hero, and an accomplished
statesman. I know that he shares our deep commitment to diplomacy and development. You deserve the
highest caliber leadership, and that is exactly what you'll get with Senator Kerry.

Subject: RE: From HRC friend
am skeptical that Jalil and al-keeb are capable either by power or by character to deal with the shortcomings of their
MinDef and Minint in this way. The latter 2 are both very powerful by virtue of their Ziritan and lvlisrata roots
respectively, and any effort to remove them would have seriousblowback. MiniNt Fawzi who I saw the other day is
clearly way ahead of his colleague in getting the thuwar into the process of registration, the first step hopefully toward
DDR. I think everybody here is aware now how difficult the disarming of these militias, which have become de facto real
institutions in and of themselves. It is naieve to think they can be dissolved by executive fiat Some positive movement-
Jordanians preparing to accept first tranche of 1500 for police training.
There is concern here that continuing rivalries among the militias remains dangerous from the perspective of the havoc
they can wreak with their firepower and their continued control of select turf. At the end of the day, I think everybody is
coming to the conclusion that the elections will take place in the context of militia control. We hope that a program can
be devised to keep them acting responsibly toward the outcome of the election, especially viz the obligations they may
well be asked to undertake to keep elections free, and fair and devoid of violence. Always danger of continuing
skirmishes but Armageddon predictions a bit overstated.
We are all worried about the situation in Kufra and the clashes between the Arab alZwai tribe and the African tribe's the
Tebu. This is again a legacy of the Qadhafi era who played on these divisions to keep himself in control. The
government believes that the Tebu are being aided from al_Qadhafi elements and perhaps government supporters in
Sudan to undermine the TNC. There are some disturbing signs that in fact the TNC may be supporting the dispatch of
select militias to deploy down there maybe rpt maybe to ""resolve"" this ethnic problem as the situation in Tewarga was
resolved-i.e., ""ethnic cleansing"" --We are only at the very beginning stages of seeing whether there is credible evidence
on this score--so please rpt please don't raise any flags about it. It would be explosive.1 will keep you informed about any
info we develop.
No surprise about Heftat-he is extremely angry he lost out on the COS spot so his efforts to undermine the new COS
Mangoosh would be fully in line with his character to be big cheese.
The war wounded is a national tragedy. The former group allowed everybody to go abroad and they did to the tune of
800 million dollars. 50,000 Libyans abroad now 15 percent receiving medical treatment Who do you think the others
are? Relatives, frauds, and those who snuck out to get botox and tummy tucks. Senator McCain will rail about our
refusal to take thousands of them to the States but the process has been so bungled I think we did as much as we could
considering.

Here is the latest on Libya. As always, let me know your thoughts.
SOURCE:
Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the highest levels of European
Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1.
On February 19, 2012, Libyan President Mustafa Abdul Ali! and Prime Minister Abdurrahim el-Keib instructed Minister
of the Interior Minister Fawzi Abd Ali and Minister of Defense Osama at Juwali to move as forcefully as possible to deal
with armed conflict between the various militias which carried the bulk of fighting during the 2011revolution against
former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi.
According to an extremely sensitive source speaking in secret, el-Keib, acting in his role as the head of government, told
the two ministers that if they could not stop the fighting and disarm the militias he would be forced to find ministers
who can carry out his orders.
Ali and Juwali each stated privately that, while they would follow orders, they have little hope of succeeding in this
matter until el-Kelb and Jalil gain credibility as the rulers of the country.
Ali added that, in his opinion, this situation will persist until a new government is chosen during the national elections
planned for later in 2012.
2.
In the opinion of this individual, the Prime Minister is particularly concerned by the situation in the Southern portion of
the country, where the area defined by the towns of Ghat, Sabha, and al Kufra, where fighting between rival tribal and
regional militias has been exacerbated by the activities of
Qaddafi loyalists, and their allies? Taureg tribal fighters.
This individual added that el-Keib and Jaill agree that the uncertain security situation in this area represents a threat to
Libya's future stability.
They agreed that, at present, iffaced with a concerted effort by either disaffected militiamen or pro-Qaddafi forces
government security forces and the new national army would be unable to protect either Libyan citizens or Western
businessmen and oil industry workers in the region.
3.(Source Comment:
In the opinion of this individual, el-Keib believes that any attack against oil field workers will frighten large Western
firms and seriously damage Libya's efforts to recover from the revolution.
This individual added that al Juwali is particularly upset with his deputy Minister and Chief of Staff of the Army, General
Yousef Mangoush, who he believes has been unable to work with national army ground force commander General
Khalifa Belqasim Hefter.
A very sensitive source added that the Benghazi based units of the army, under Haftar's direct command, are currently
deploying to the area southeast of al-Kufra, along the Sudanese border.)
4.
In the opinion of a sensitive source, Haftar and at Aswan believe that the Sudanese military is providing arms and
supplies to the pro-Qaddafi forces, under direct orders from Sudanese President Omar al Bashir.
El-Keib complained to al-Juevall that Haftar's forces passed through al-Kufra region during early and mid-February on
their way to the Sudanese border, however; they did nothing to disarm the local revolutionary militias, or stop the
fighting between competing tribal groups.
In the opinion of this individual, Hefter felt that the threat from the pro-Qaddafi forces was greater than that posed by
the regional and tribal fighting.
5.
At the same time, a source with excellent access to the leadership of the National Transitional Council (NTC) stated in
secret that fighting continues between regional, tribal, and religious rivals throughout the Northern/Mediterranean
portions of the country.

This same source added that the ongoing struggle between the Misrata and Zintan militias for control of the area west
of Tripoli is particularly violent and disruptive for the rest of the country.
In the capital itself, fighting continues between regional groups, the national army, Islamist militias, and criminal street
gangs, all of whom are very well armed.
This individual reports that during mid-February 2012 ei-Keib and Jatil agreed to address the problem of disaffected
former militiamen and their families by providing payments of 2,000 Dinars (approximately $1,500) per month to the
families of fighters who were wounded or killed in the revolution.
6.
In addition the President and Prime Minister instructed Minister of Finance Hassan Ziglam to develop an efficient
system to provide assistance funds to unemployed former fighters.
For his part, Ziglarri privately expressed concern that previous efforts in this regard have met with a high level of fraud.
According to the government's best estimates, the revolutionary army included approximately 25,000 combat troops,
but it is difficult to identify those with legitimate claims, as no accurate service records were maintained.
That said, he stated in private that the government must be seen to take some form of direct action, even If money is
paid to fraudulent claimants.
The fact Is, according to Ziglam, the NTC Is losing control of the country and must give something to the veterans of the
revolution to slow this process.
7.(Source Comment: Speaking in strictest confidence, a knowledgeable individual stated that al-Juwali is
concerned by the possibility that the country may deteriorate into a multi-sided civil war involving the regional militias,
Islamist forces and the national army.
At the same time, he acknowledges that the new army has lost control of large portions of the southern part of the
country, with tribal fighting spilling over into Mali and Chad.
According to this source, al-Juwali is also frustrated by the slow pace of military and police training promised to the
various Libyan national security forces by the governments of France and Turkey.
He added that, while Turkey has received some of the most seriously wound troops for treatment, the lack of
adequate medical care for veterans inside of Libya remains a major source of conflict between the former rebel troops
and the Nit government.

Subject RE: From HRC friend
I am skeptical that Jalii and al-keeb are capable either by power or by character to deal with the shortcomings of their
MinDef and Minint in this way. The latter 2 are both very powerful by virtue of their Zintan and Misrata roots
respectively, and any effort to remove them would have seriousblowback. MiniNt Fawzi who I saw the other day is
dearly way ahead of his colleague in getting the thuwar into the process of registration, the first step hopefully toward
DDR. I think everybody here is aware now how difficult the disarming of these militias, which have become de facto real
institutions in and of themselves. It is naieve to think they can be dissolved by executive fiat. Some positive movement
Jordanians preparing to accept first tranche of 1500 for police training.
There is concern here that continuing rivalries among the militias remains dangerous from the perspective of the havoc
they can wreak with their firepower and their continued control of select turf. At the end of the day, I think everybody is
coming to the conclusion that the elections will take place in the context of militia control. We hope that a program can
be devised to keep them acting responsibly toward the outcome of the election, especially viz the obligations they may
well be asked to undertake to keep elections free, and fair and devoid of violence. Always danger of continuing
skirmishes but Armageddon predictions a bit overstated.
We are all worried about the situation in Kufra and the clashes between the Arab alZwai tribe and the African tribals the
Tebu. This is again a legacy of the Qadhafi era who played on these divisions to keep himself in control. The
government believes that the Tebu are being aided from al_Qadhafi elements and perhaps government supporters in
Sudan to undermine the TNC. There are some disturbing signs that in fact the INC may be supporting the dispatch of
select militias to deploy down there maybe rpt maybe to ""resolve"" this ethnic problem as the situation in Tewarga was
resolved e, ""ethnic cleansing"" â€”We are only at the very beginning stages of seeing whether there is credible evidence
on this scoreâ€”so please rpt please don't raise any flags about it It would be explosive] will keep you informed about any
info we develop.
No surprise about Heftar-he is extremely angry he lost out on the COS spot so his efforts to undermine the new COS
Marv:posh would be fully in line with his character to be big cheese.

Re: France & UK behind Libya breakup
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the highest levels of
European Governments, the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, and Western Intelligence and security services
1. During the period between mid-January 2012 to March 2012 officers of the a French General Directorate for
External Security ( Direction Generale de la Securite Exterieure Dcsp, and the British Secret Intelligence Service
(SISâ€”Ml-8) activated longstanding contacts with tribal and civic leaders in Eastern Libya, in an effort to encourage them
to establish a semi-autonomous zone in the historic province of Cyrenaica (Barge in Arabic). According to extremely
knowledgeable sources, this effort was initiated by advisors to French President Nicholas Sarkozy after complaints from
concerned French business leaders that the new Libyan Government was not rewarding appropriately French firms for the
leading role France played in supporting the 2011 revolution against former Dictator Muammar al Qaddafi. SIS joined in
this effort at the instruction of the office of Prime Minister David Cameron. This highly confidential effort comes in
response to the inability of the National Transitional Council (NTC) government in Tripoli to organize the country
effectively and deal with Western business interests in an effective and efficient manner.
2. The French and British business and intelligence officials believe that a semi-autonomous regime in the
Eastern city of Benghazi will be able to organize business opportunities in that region. This in turn will allow these
Western firms to initiate new business projects. These same officials believe that there is also reduced threat from
Islamist militias in the East. According to a knowledgeable source, French officials believe that this situation is the natural
result of el-Keib's failure to organize the country and disarm the ethnic and regional militias who did the majority of the
fighting against Qaddafi's forces during the revolution.
3. (Source Comment: In the opinion of a very sensitive source, the French Government and business leaders
actually expected to receive thirty five (35) per cent of new economic development in Libya after the fall of Qaddafi. Like
many Western businessmen, these French officials made informal agreements with former Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril
and his advisors, only to see these agreements ignored or delayed when Abdurrahim el-Keib became head of government
in October 2011. In their opinion, once el-Keib moved the government from the Eastern city of Benghazi to the national
capital at Tripoli, the government became inefficient and inaccessible. These individuals also believe that the

appointment of Minister of Oil Abduirahman Ben Yezza, who was a long time official of the Italian oil Company (EN!), was
a factor. According to these sources, the bulk of ENI's oil fields are in the Western part of Libya, and Ben Yezza focused
his attentions on that region, while failing to effectively organize new business East of Benghazi. These same officials
state that the influences of the Western militias, particularly those from the Zintan region, have weakened the influence of
the Eastern Elders.)
4. An extremely sensitive source stated that the DGSE and SIS intend to control the move toward a semi-
autonomous state under a federal system, However, they have been surprised by el-Keites intention, expressed both in
public and in secret meetings with Minister of Defense Ousama al JUWali, a native of Zintan, to use force to hold the
country together. El-Keth is also committed to Ben Yezza, although he is frustrated by the chaotic situation in Tripoli. This
atmosphere affects new business for the most part and has been extremely irritating for businessmen from France and
other Western countries.
5, (Source Comment: in the opinion of a well placed source with access to the former royal family (al Senussi),
while these Western officials are focused on working around the chaotic business situation, they are risking a civil war,
failing to reci !nized the longstanding and complicated relationship between the Eastern and Western parts of the country.
Qaddafi, as an absolute dictator, suppressed these differences, which have reemerged with his defeat and death. In
addition, el-Keib is talking to old acquaintances in the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, in an effort to apply their influence to
the Eastern tribal Eiders, and help hold the country together.)

Defense Ousama al Juwali, a native of Zintan, to use force to hold the country together. El-Keib
is also committed to Ben Yezza, although he is frustrated by the chaotic situation in Tripoli. This
atmosphere affects new business for the most part and has been extremely irritating for
businessmen from France and other Western countries
5. (Source Comment: In the opinion of a well placed source with access to the former
royal family (al Senussi), while these Western officials are focused on working around the
chaotic business situation, they are risking a civil war, failing to recognized the longstanding and
complicated relationship between the Eastern and Western parts of the country. Qaddafi, as an
absolute dictator, suppressed these differences, which have reemerged with his defeat and death.
In addition, el-Keib is talking to old acquaintances in the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, in an
effort to apply their influence to the Eastern tribal Elders, and help hold the country together.)

Re. France & UK behind Libya breakup
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the highest levels of
European Governments, the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1. During the period between mid-January 2012 to March 2012 officers of the a French General Directorate for
External Security ( Direction Generale de la Securite Exterieure â€” DGSE), and the British Secret Intelligence Service
(SISâ€”MI-6) activated long standing contacts with tribal and civic leaders in Eastern Libya, in an effort to encourage them
to establish a semi-autonomous zone in the historic province of Cyrenaica (Barge in Arabic). According to extremely
knowledgeable sources, this effort was initiated by advisors to French President Nicholas Sarkozy after complaints from
concerned French business leaders that the new Libyan Government was not rewarding appropriately French firms for the
leading role France played in supporting the 2011 revolution against former Dictator Muammar al Qaddafi. SIS joined in
this effort at the instruction of the office of Prime Minister David Cameron. This highly confidential effort comes in
response to the inability of the National Transitional Council (NTC) government in Tripoli to organize the country
effectively and deal with Western business interests in an effective and efficient manner.
2. The French and British business and intelligence officials believe that a semi autonomous regime in the
Eastern city of Benghazi will be able to organize business opportunities in that region. This in turn will allow these
Western firms to initiate new business projects. These same officials believe that there is also reduced threat from
Islamist militias in the East. According to a knowledgeable source, French officials believe that this situation is the natural
result of el-Keib's failure to organize the country and disarm the ethnic and regional militias who did the majority of the
fighting against Qaddafi's forces during the revolution.

3. (Source Comment: In the opinion of a very sensitive source, the French Government and business leaders
actually expected to receive thirty five (35) per cent of new economic development in Libya after the fall of Qaddafi. Like
many Western businessmen, these French officials made informal agreements with former Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril
and his advisors, only to see these agreements ignored or delayed when Abdurrahim el-Keib became head of government
in October 2011. In their opinion, once el-Keib moved the government from the Eastern city of Benghazi to the national
capital at Tripoli, the government became inefficient and inaccessible. These individuals also believe that the
appointment of Minister of Oil Abdulrahman Ben Yezza, who was a long time official of the Italian Oil Company (EN!), was
a factor. According to these sources, the bulk of ENI's oil fields are in the Western part of Libya, and Ben Yezza focused
his attentions on that region, while failing to effectively organize new business East of Benghazi. These same officials
state that the influences of the Western militias, particularly those from the Zintan region, have weakened the influence of
the Eastern Elders.)
4. An extremely sensitive source stated that the DGSE and SIS.intend to control the move toward a semi-
autonomous state under a federal system. However, they have been surprised by el-Keib's intention, expressed both in
public and in secret meetings with Minister of Defense OUSetrill al JuwaIi, a native of Zintan, to use force to hold the
country together. El-Kelb is also committed to Ben Van, although he is frustrated by the chaotic situation in Tripoli. This
atmosphere affects new business for the most port and has been extremely irritating for businessmen from France and
other Western countries.

Below is the latest report from HRC's contact; would be interested in your reactions.
SOURCE:
Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the highest levels of European
Governments, the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1.
During the last week of March 2012, the leaders of the National Transitional Council (NTC) regime in Libya discussed
the rising popularity and independence of the Libyan Muslim Brotherhood (LMB) in preparation for the national
parliamentary elections scheduled for July 2012.
According to a source with direct access to these discussions, President Mustafa Abclel Jalil stated in very direct terms
that he sees the emergence of the LMB as a major factor in the upcoming elections, which are already complicated by
the Federalist movement for the semi autonomous status of the historic Eastern Libyan region of
Cyrenaica (Barge in Arabic).
Minister of Defense Ousarra al Juwali and Prime Minister Abdurrahirn el Keib both believe that the rise of the LMB,
which was a relatively minor member of the NTC until November 2011, is, in fact, related to the Federalist movement fl
Eastern Libya.

According to al Juwali, a native of the Western Libyan region of Zintan, the LMB is drawing strength from people who
fear that the Federalist movement in Barqa will result in that region dominating the country, gaining control of an
inordinate share of the country's oil and mineral reserves.
For his part, Jalil stated that he agrees with Oil Minister Abdulrahman Ben Yezza that if matters are not resolved by the
July elections, the unsettled nature of the political process in Libya will damage the country's image as a business
partner and confuse foreign banks and oil firms attempting to open new contacts with the new Libyan Government, or
reactivate existing agreements.
2.
According to a sensitive source, while discussing this matter with Dr Abd al-Nasser Shamata, the head of the Crisis
Management Unit in the NTC, Prime Minister el Keib stated that the most problematic aspect of the rise of the LMB is
the leadership role taken by Islamist militia leader General Abdel Hakim Alamin Belhaj.
In the opinion of this source, the NTC leadership sees Belhaj as one of the greatest threats to the long term success of
their regime.
Al Juwali also notes that Belhaj is the head of the founding committee for the LMB's Justice and Construction Party
(JCP). As the Federalist movement took hold in early March 2012, al Juwali, under instruction from el Keib and Jalil, met
with Belhaj and other Western militia leaders to arrange for their support In the event military force is needed to hold
the country together.
Belhaj represented the most effective of the Western militias.
3.
According to the Minister of Defense, this situation with the Federalist movement enhanced Belhaj's prestige at the
time he was working to secure a leadership role in the LMB and the JCP.
El Keib and Jalil are concerned that, despite the fact that the LMB has a limited base after years of suppression by the
regime of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi, they will appeal to those Libyans who believe that the NTC regime is
under the influence of the United States and Western Europe.
The activities of Belhaj in both the LMB and the JCP reinforce this view.
Jalil finds this situation frustrating, particularly in the light of his regular assurances that Libya would operate under
Islamic law, and while maintaining appropriate ties to the West, will remain hostile to Israel.
4. (Source Comment:
In a private conversation, Jalil stated that he is working to balance the internal political realities of Libya against the
concerns of the international business community.
The President is concerned that the appointment of BenYezza as Oil Minister in October 2011 provided the JCP with a
tangible concern to use against NTC candidates during the July elections.
After his long experience as a senior official of the Multinational Italian Oil Firm ENI, Ben Yezza is viewed by Belhaj and
many members of the LMB as a symbol of the issue they will pursue in the national election, the idea that NTC, like the
Qaddafi, regime is corrupt and involved in allowing foreign interests to control the nation's mineral wealth.
That said, Jalil continues to agree with el Keib that Ben Yezza is an excellent administrator, and in the long run will play
an important role in effectively managing the nation's mineral wealth.)
5.
According to an extremely sensitive source, Jalil and his advisors have been in contact with Supreme Guide Mohamed
Badie, the leader of the much larger and more powerful Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood (EMB).
This contact is largely based on the President's need to address reports he has received that the LMB is reaching out to
Badie and his advisors for support.
This effort is particularly important given the belief among NTC leaders that the EMB and its Freedom and Justice Party
(FJP) will control the Government of Egypt as that country moves to civilian rule later in 2012. In the opinion of this
source, Badie is sympathetic to Jalil's position, especially since the Libyan President and el Keib were members of the
EMB during their student days in Egypt.
The Supreme Guide will, according to Jalil, work to influence the LMB to establish a cooperative effort with the NTC.
Badie will point out the fact that his ability to cooperate with both the Supreme Council for the Armed Force (SCAF), as
well as the Salafist al Nour party, helped establish the EMB as the dominant political force in Egypt, while avoiding high
levels of violence.
6.
(Source Comment: An extremely sensitive source within the EMB agreed that Badie and Jalil have spoken in an effort to
develop a plan to deal with the LMB.

According to this source, Jalil told Badie that the LMB and the JCP are far more intolerant of foreign business and
banking interests than the NTC, and a strong showing in the July elections will strengthen Belhaj and other conservative
Islamists, adversely affecting the Libyan economy, which in turn will cause problems for Egypt as it recovers from its own
revolution in 2011.
Jalil emphasized that at this point the NTC has managed to avoid violent outbursts between competing groups, even in
the face of the Federalist movement in the East, in a region that borders Egypt.
He warned that an LMB/JCP victory might change this and lead to increased violence between rival militias that could
wash over into Egypt.)
7.
According to a sensitive source, the LMB has a complex history and Jalil and el Keib believe this past may hold some
points which can be used against the Brotherhood and the JCP in the July elections.
The TNTC leaders know that after Qaddafi came to power in 1969, the LMB was repressed and many of its leaders were
executed publicly. Eventually the Brotherhood, having reestablished itself in the United States and Europe, entered into
a dialogue with the Qaddafi regime 1999, and in 2005 began a series of negotiations with SW al-Islam Qaddafi, whose
goal was to co-opt and neutralize opposition groups, particularly Islamist ones.
8.
According to this individual, Belhaj and the other Islamist leaders mistrusted the LMB during the first months of the
2011 revolution.
However, Belhaj eventually established a working relationship with Fawzi Abu Kitef, the head of the Revolutionary
Brigades Coalition in Eastern Libya and the former deputy defense minister in the NTC. Abu Kltef was a leading figure in
the LMB who spent more than 18 years in prison, including the notorious facility at Abu SeIlm. Under Abu Kitef and
leaders like Dr. Abdullah Shamia, who was in charge of the economic committee of the NTC, the Brotherhood
established itself as a unique group within the Jai Keib regime; serving there until they began to plan for
independent political activity in late 2011 and early 2012.
9.
In early 2012, as the relationship between the NTC and Belhaj and the other Islamists deteriorated in the face of
regional and ethnic power struggles, the LMB leadership, in coordination with Belhaj began to look at an independent
political effort in the parliamentary elections. During its first public conference in Benghazi during November 2011, the
LMB elected a new leader, increased its consultative council membership from 11 to 30 leaders, and decided to form a
political party; the JCP.
Mohammed Swan, the former head of the Libyan LMB's Consultative Council, won a tight victory over longtime LMB
leader Soliman Abd al-Qadr, to become the first leader of the JCP. Bashir al-Kubty was elected General Observer of the
LMB.
10.(Source comment: According to an individual with excellent access, the LMB leaders are sensitive to charges
that the JCP is a party with a narrow religious agenda, and they encouraged Walid al-Sakran, non-member of the LMB, to
compete as a candidate for JCP leadership.
That said Belhaj and other Islamist leaders believe that the LMB is set to follow the electoral path of Islamist success
seen in Egypt, Tunisia, and other Arab countries.
Belhaj now believes that the country will move forward under sharia law, administered by the Islamist bloc, including
the LMB/JCP

This effort is particularly important given the belief among NTC leaders that the EMB and its Freedom and Justice Party
(FJP) will control the Government of Egypt as that country moves to civilian rule later in 2012. In the opinion of this
source, Badie is sympathetic to Jalil's position, especially since the Libyan President and el Keib were members of the
EMB during their student days in Egypt.
The Supreme Guide will, according to Jalil, work to influence the LMB to establish a cooperative effort with the NTC.
Sadie will point out the fact that his ability to cooperate with both the Supreme Council for the Armed Force (SCAF), as
well as the Salafist al Nour party, helped establish the EMB as the dominant political force in Egypt, while avoiding high
levels of violence.
6.
(Source Comment: An extremely sensitive source within the EMB agreed that Badie and Jalil have spoken in an effort to
develop a plan to deal with the LMB.
According to this source, Jalil told Badie that the LMB and the JCP are far more intolerant of foreign business and
banking interests than the NTC, and a strong showing in the July elections will strengthen Belhaj and other conservative
Islamists, adversely affecting the Libyan economy, which in turn will cause problems for Egypt as it recovers from its own
revolution in 2011.
Jaill emphasized that at this point the NTC has managed to avoid violent outbursts between competing groups, even in
the face of the Federalist movement in the East, in a region that borders Egypt.
He warned that an LMB/JCP victory might change this and lead to increased violence between rival militias that could
wash over into Egypt.)
7.
According to a sensitive source, the LMB has a complex history and Jalil and el Keib believe this past may hold some
points which can be used against the Brotherhood and the JCP in the July elections.
The TNTC leaders know that after Qaddafi came to power in 1969, the LMB was repressed and many of its leaders were
executed publicly. Eventually the Brotherhood, having reestablished itself in the United States and Europe, entered into
a dialogue with the Qaddafi regime 1999, and in 2005 began a series of negotiations with Saif al-Islam Qaddafi, whose
goal was to co-opt and neutralize opposition groups, particularly Islamist ones.
8.
According to this individual, Belhaj and the other Islamist leaders mistrusted the LMB during the first months of the
2011 revolution.
However, Belhaj eventually established a working relationship with Fawzi Abu Kitef, the head of the Revolutionary
Brigades Coalition in Eastern Libya and the former deputy defense minister in the NTC. Abu Kitef was a leading figure in
the LMB who spent more than 18 years in prison, including the notorious facility at Abu Selim. Under Abu Kitef and
leaders like Dr. Abdullah Shamia, who was in charge of the economic committee of the NTC, the Brotherhood
established itself as a unique group within the Jalil/el Keib regime; serving there until they began to plan for
independent political activity in late 2011 and early 2012.
9.
In early 2012, as the relationship between the NTC and Belhaj and the other Islamists deteriorated in the face of
regional and ethnic power struggles, the LMB leadership, in coordination with Belhaj began to look at an independent
political effort in the parliamentary elections. During its first public conference in Benghazi during November 2011, the
LMB elected a new leader, increased its consultative council membership from 11 to 30 leaders, and decided to form a
political party; the JCP.
Mohammed Swan, the former head of the Libyan LMB's Consultative Council, won a tight victory over longtime LMB
leader Solirnan Abd al-Qadr, to become the first leader of the JCP. Bashir al-Kubty was elected General Observer of the
LMB.
10.(Source comment: According to an individual with excellent access, the LMB leaders are sensitive to charges
that the JCP is a party with a narrow religious agenda, and they encouraged Walid al-Sakran, non-member of the LMB, to
compete as a candidate for JCP leadership.
That said Belhaj and other Islamist leaders believe that the LMB is set to follow the electoral path of Islamist success
seen in Egypt, Tunisia, and other Arab countries.

February 28 â€” HRC travels to Geneva, Switzerland for consultations with European partners on Libya. She gives a major
address in which she says: ""Colonel Qadhafi and those around him must be held accountable for these acts, which
violate international legal obligations and common decency. Through their actions, they have lost the legitimacy to
govern. And the people of Libya have made themselves
clear: It is time for Qadhafi to go â€” now, without further violence or delay."" She also works to secure the suspension of
Libya from membership in the Human Rights Council.

Jake: I have been reading this over and over and it just seemed a bit odd to me. I finally figured out that I think the
source has somehow confused two Bel-Hajs: One is our boy who accused us and the Brits of rendition-Abdul Hakim Bel-
Haj and a second one is Larnin Bel Haj, an Islamist leader who I believe had previously I believe somehow been involved
In Sudan but was now back in his native Ubya. The latter is the head of the JCP and MB. The former is of the former LIFG
and now the Libyan Islamist Movement for Change and the premier Western Brigade commander whose group had
control over Matega Airport for several months after October 23 and who tried to make himself the Supreme Military
Council Commander of Tripoli before the TNC leadership stepped in several months ago. Let me try to untangle this and
see if any of it jibes with the reality we are seeing.

Very interesting report. By chance, I met with our insightful in Benghazi yesterday and we discussed B6
the LIVIB's electoral prospects. He didn't think they would have a large following b/c they don't have a strong
organization and because most Libyans view the LMB as a branch of the Egyptian MB, and Libyans don't want to be
ruled by Egypt. He did not mention the interesting point below about the LMB as a counterbalance to the eastern based
Federalists. He did emphasize, though, that the Federalist movement has widespread support in the east and will
continue to up the ante with Tripoli, including possibly making a move on the oil production in that part of the country
(AGOCO, a large state-owned oil company, is based in Benghazi). -- Chris

Below is the latest report from NBC's contact; would be interested in your reactions.
SOURCE:
Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the highest levels of European
Governments, the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1.
During the last week of March 2012, the leaders of the National Transitional Council (NTC) regime in Libya discussed
the rising popularity and independence of the Libyan Muslim Brotherhood (LMB) in preparation for the national
parliamentary elections scheduled for July 2012.
According to a source with direct access to these discussions, President Mustafa Abdel Jalil stated in very direct terms
that he sees the emergence of the LMB as a major factor in the upcoming elections, which are already complicated by
the Federalist movement for the semi-autonomous status of the historic Eastern Libyan region of
Cyrenaica (Berea in Arabic).
Minister of Defense Ousama al Juwall and Prime Minister Abdurrahim el Keib both believe that the rise of the LMB,
which was a relatively minor member of the NTC until November 2011, is, in fact, related to the Federalist movement in
Eastern Libya.
According to at Juwali, a native of the Western Libyan region of Zintan, the LMB is drawing strength from people who
fear that the Federalist movement in Barge will result in that region dominating the country, gaining control of an
inordinate share of the country's oil and mineral reserves.
For his part, Jalil stated that he agrees with Oil Minister Abcluirahman Ben 'lima that if matters are not resolved by the
July elections, the unsettled nature of the political process in Libya will damage the country's image as a business
partner and confuse foreign banks and oil firms attempting to open new contacts with the new Libyan Government, or
reactivate existing agreements.
2.
According to a sensitive source, while discussing this matter with Dr Abd al-Nasser Shamata, the head of the Crisis
Management Unit in the NTC, Prime Minister el Keib stated that the most problematic aspect of the rise of the LMB is
the leadership role taken by Islamist militia leader General Abdel Hakim Alamin Belhaj.
In the opinion of this source, the NTC leadership sees Belhaj as one of the greatest threats to the long term success of
their regime.
Al Juwali also notes that Belhaj is the head of the founding committee for the LMB's Justice and Construction Party
(JCP). As the Federalist movement took hold in early March 2012, al Juwali, under instruction from el Keib and Jalil, met
with Belhaj and other Western militia leaders to arrange for their support in the event military force is needed to hold
the country together.
Beihaj represented the most effective of the Western militias.
3.
According to the Minister of Defense, this situation with the Federalist movement enhanced Belhaj's prestige at the
time he was working to secure a leadership role in the LMB and the JCP.
El Keib and Jalil are concerned that, despite the fact that the LMB has a limited base after years of suppression by the
regime of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi, they will appeal to those Libyans who believe that the NTC regime is
under the influence of the United States and Western Europe.
The activities of Belhaj in both the LMB and the JCP reinforce this view.
Jalil finds this situation frustrating, particularly in the light of his regular assurances that Libya would operate under
Islamic law, and while maintaining appropriate ties to the West, will remain hostile to Israel.

In a private conversation, Jalil stated that he is working to balance the internal political realities of Libya against the
concerns of the international business community.
The President is concerned that the appointment of BenYezza as Oil Minister in October 2011 provided the JCP with a
tangible concern to use against NTC candidates during the July elections.
After his long experience as a senior official of the Multinational Italian Oil Firm ENI, Ben Yezza is viewed by Belhaj and
many members of the LMB as a symbol of the issue they will pursue in the national election, the idea that NTC, like the
Qaddafi, regime is corrupt and involved in allowing foreign interests to control the nation's mineral wealth.
That said, Jalil continues to agree with el Keib that Ben Yezza is an excellent administrator, and in the long run will play
an important role in effectively managing the nation's mineral wealth.)
5.
According to an extremely sensitive source, Jalil and his advisors have been in contact with Supreme Guide Mohamed
Badie, the leader of the much larger and more powerful Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood (EMB).
This contact is largely based on the President's need to address reports he has received that the LMB is reaching out to
Badie and his advisors for support.
This effort is particularly important given the belief among NTC leaders that the EMB and its Freedom and Justice Party
(FJP) will control the Government of Egypt as that country moves to civilian rule later in 2012. In the opinion of this
source, Badie is sympathetic to Jalirs position, especially since the Libyan President and el Keib were members of the
EMB during their student days in Egypt.
The Supreme Guide will, according to J3111, work to influence the LMB to establish a cooperative effort with the NTC.

well as the Salafist al Nour party, helped establish the EMB as the dominant political force in Egypt, while avoiding high

Jalil emphasized that at this point the NTC has managed to avoid violent outbursts between competing groups, even in

Jake- Interesting report. Gene is closer to the action and I defer to him on the latest Jail-ian thinking
and machinations vis-a-vis the cabinet and INC. I hadn't heard about ENI-related corruption but
wouldn't be surprised.
On the federalism issue,. Jail is right to be concerned about eastern agitation for autonomy. A
cabinet chance won't solve that problem, though. Nor will recruiting Belhaj and Islamist fighters to
take on the Bardans. To the contrary, it would only lead to unwanted bloodshed - the large Obeid
tribe still nurses a serious grudge against Belhaj and his ilk for the Islamists' presumed role in killing their
beloved Gen. Yunis last July and would probably put up a fierce fight.
The cabinet and INC need to have a serious discussion with the Bargans - if they aren't already
doing so - about how power and resources are to be distributed in the new Libya. The Libyans held
similarly heated debates on this very topic in the early1950s as they held their first parliamentary
elections and drafted their constitution (there were actually violent skirmishes in connection with
those elections, and Washington delayed the arrival of the first US ambassador until after things had
calmed down). Hopefully the current leadership can negotiate these issues peaceably in the
corning months. Of course, we and the UN and our other partners should encourage them to do so.

Let me know your thoughts:
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the highest levels of
European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1.On April 17, 2012 Libyan National Transitional Council (NTC) President Mustafa Abdel Jalil stated to a close
advisor that he is considering when, or even if, to hold a vote of no confidence in the NTC regarding support for the
government of Prime Minister Abdel Rahman al-Keib. According to a source with access to the NTC leadership, Jalil
realizes that a majority of the Council members no longer support el-Keib and his cabinet of Western educated technical
experts. Jaili continues to believe that, for the moment, the most important issue facing the NTC is the federalist
movement toward a semi-autonomous state in the Eastern region of Cyrenaica (Barge in Arabic). This situation continues
to complicate the NTC efforts to stabilize the country. With this in mind, Jalil expressed concern that a dramatic vote of no
confidence for el-Keib will weaken the entire NTC by association. Instead, according to this source, Jalil is considering
delaying a CiOCISI011, possibly putting it off until an elected legislature is in place in the late summer or early fall of 2012.
2. (Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, the NTC has been able to reach a temporary
understanding with the eastern federalists, allowing the separatists to administer their local regions, while deferring to the
NTC for national and international issues. The complicating factor at this point lies in reaching a determination regarding
who has authority over new contracts with oil companies and other international firms. As of the week of April 16, 2012,
no decision has been reached on this point. The bulk of the NTC leadership is drawn from Barge, and Jalil now believes
they can control the situation if they can establish an organized central government. In particular, Jalil, according to a
sensitive source, is increasingly confident that the eastern roots of the NTC will allow him to balance the federalist
movement against the need for a sense of national unity. In the opinion of this source, el-Keib's future depends on Jalil's
opinion of his capacity to deal with this complex situation.)
3. Minister of Defense Ousama al Juwali is viewed by Jalil as the most important western Libyan in el-Keib's
cabinet, and the President and the leaders of the NTC had hoped that he would be able to deal with the confused security
situation in Tripoli. However, while he did receive assurances from General Abdel Hakim Alamin Belhaj regarding
possible assistance from his Islamist troops if fighting broke out between the National Army and the militia's loyal to the
eastern federalists. Unfortunately, from Jalil's point of view, this effort seems to have emboldened Belhaj and heightened
tension between the eastern and western portions of the country. According to this source, after reviewing the federalist
problem, Dr Abd al-Nasser Shamata, the head of the Crisis Management for the NTC, believes that el-Keib, al Juwali, Oil
Minister Abdulrahman Ben Yezza, and the bulk of the cabinet should be replaced by people drawn from within the NTC,
individuals who are in touch with the concerns of the Libyan people of all tribes and political groups. In the opinion of this
source Jalil is factoring this position into his decision on el-Keib.
4. Regarding the existing relationships with international oil firms, Shamata told Jalil that for the most part the
existing fields are continuing to produce and the owners have worked out security arrangements with local political and
tribal leaders. However, since el-Keib and Ben Yezza have been unable to bring order to the national administration, it is
difficult for firms to initiate new projects, since it is not clear who has the authority or the desire to sign such
agreements. Shamata stated forcefully that the Prime Minister, whoever he is, must establish an orderly administration
before full advantage can be gained from the oil fields. In the meantime, Shamata warns that his office has found
evidence of corruption between local officials and international firms. In this regard, he stated that local representatives of
the Italian national oil firm (ENI) have made problematic arrangements with local officials in the western part of the
country, where their oil fields are located. He added that most of these ENI employees are Libyans, but he believes ENI
management in Italy is aware of this situation. Shamata pointed out, without additional comment, that Ben Yezza is a
long time senior official of ENI.
5. In the opinion this source, Shamata and Jalil are not planning to publicize these charges regarding ENI, at least
until they decide how best to move forward on el-Keib, whether to allow the Prime Minister more time to address his
problems, proceed with the vote of no confidence or quietly ask him to step down on his own.
6. (Source Comment: According to this source, el-Keib is under fire primarily as a result of his failure to bring
order to the National Army, disarm independent militias, and establish security throughout the country. The leading
opposition to el-Keib is based in the Political Issues committee of the NTC, and as many as 42 of the 73 active NTC
members will vote against el-Keib if Jalil brings this matter to a vote. The source warns that these numbers are provided
by members of this Political committee, who may have their own agenda. A two thirds majority is required for the no
confidence vote, however; several senior members of the NTC are reluctant to take such a step until a constituent
assembly has been elected. They do not want this to look like the decision of a small group of people.)

Subject: Talk with PM
I called PM el-Keib this morning to get his take on what we were all hearing about TNC final decisions to dismiss the
government, etc. I told him that after the British Ambassador and I had spoken to him and Jalil on Sunday, we had
hoped that these public skirmishes would end and that the government could focus on security and the elections. The
PM said that he had in fact met with Jalil on Monday and agreed to work together for the good of the nation. On
Tuesday, the PM had met with several Council members and had brought along proposed changes in some of the
ministerial portfolios. He sensed there was agreement from the Council members present and thought he had
succeeded in quelling the public discontent. Unfortunately, he continued, more public threats, etc. were issued and by
Wednesday evening he had had enough. That prompted his critical remarks in a press interview demanding that the TNC
stop interfering in the government's business and let him and his government do the work they needed to do without all
this negative background noise. He told me that we should not be concerned about last night's ""rumors"" and that he
would continue to work to end these fratricidal disputes. For his own role, he said he would be just as happy to give up
his post if matters came to that We will continue to try to reach out to other contacts today to see if in fact the Council
does intend to act against the government. But while the PM is clearly frustrated, he also seemed to believe that the
current strife will not result in any major shake-up, at least for the time being.

Re: Libyan election
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the highest levels of
European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1. Libyan National Transitional Council (NTC) President Mustafa Abdel Jalil expected the final days leading to the
July 7, 2012 national elections to be complicated and sometimes violent; however, according to a knowledgeable
individual, he is particularly concerned by the level of control exerted by regional militia's and political groups on the
electoral process. In the opinion of this individual, Jalil and his advisors believe that, given the level of suspicion and
frustration felt in the various parts of the country, it will be difficult for the new 200 seat General National Congress (GNC)
to establish its authority, draft a new constitution, and establish new national government. With this in mind, Jalil stated in
extreme confidence that the NTC may have to remain in power until the situation becomes stable and a new government
is firmly in place. That said he still plans to have interim Prime Minister Abdel Rahman el-Keib step down after the
election results have been certified. The NTC will then work with the GNC as it takes shape to choose a new Prime
Minister and Cabinet. Jalil would like to keep several ministers from the el-Keib government in the new regime,
particularly Minister of Defense Ousama al-Juwali.
2. According to this individual, Jalil wants to maintain a degree of security and stability in an effort to reassure
foreign businesses and banks that Libya will not descend into civil war and chaos. At the same time, the NTC must deal
with the regional issues that divide the country's three electoral regions: Tripolitania in the West, Cyrenaica (Barge) in the
East, and Fezzan in the South. In the weeks leading up to the election the failure of the NTC to resolve these differences
has strengthened the federalist movement in Barge while antagonizing the tribal leaders in the South. Both groups are
calling on their followers to boycott the election while the Southerners are calling for the National Army to withdraw its
forces from the area around the town of Kufra, where they are deployed to stop fighting between tribal militias. At the
same time, on July 1 federalist supporters attacked electoral offices in Benghazi, protesting the influence of Tripoli and the
Western region on the upcoming elections.

3. (Source Comment: In the opinion of a knowledgeable individual, the division of the 200 seats in the GNC lies
at the heart of this matter, with 120 seats allotted for the Tripolitania, 60 for Barqa, and 18 for the Fezzan area. At
present, the Libyan Muslim Brotherhood (LMB) and its political arm, the Justice and Construction Party (JCP), are
attempting to mount a national campaign, receiving discreet advice and technical support from the Egyptian Muslim
Brotherhood (EMB). With this assistance, Jalil is convinced that the JCP is the party that operates most effectively
throughout the country. Jalil has established ties to the EMB, from whom he has learned that JCP leader Mohamad
Sowan and his associates are working with the leadership of the EMB.)
4. According to his sources, Jalil believes that he can work with Sowan and the LMB/JCP; however, he is
concerned that Mohammed Morsi, the newly elected EMB President of Egypt, and EMB Supreme Guide Mohammed
Badie are focused on developing Egyptian influence in Libya. Jalil has been informed privately that these EMB leaders
want to establish a strong position in Libya, particularly in the oil services sector as part of their effort to improve Egypt's
economic situation. Libyan officials in Cairo and Jalil's own associates are warning him that the Egyptians may see the
NTC as a potential barrier to their effort and are advising Sowan to press for an early withdrawal of Jalil and the NTC from
Libyan politics. For his part, Jalil has attempted to avoided direct conflict with the LMB/JCP, focusing his attention, and
that of the el-Keib interim government on trying to deal with the unrest in the period leading up to the national elections.
5. According to a particularly sensitive source, Jalil believes that Sowan will need the assistance of the Libyan
National Party (LNP), the Islamist group led by religious scholar Ali al-Salabi and former Islamist militant
General Abdel Hakim Alamin Belhaj to gain enough seats to control the GNC. While there are significant personal
conflicts between Sowan and Belhaj, Jalil believes that the two groups could work together to gain control of the
government. In this case, Jalil believes the new regime would move quickly to oust the NTC, and establish a more
conservative Islamist regime. At the same time, since the LNP is a Tripoli based movement, Jalil fears that the tribal
federalists in Barqa might react violently to them gaining an important role in the new government. Since the Barqa
leaders are urging their followers to boycott the election, a strong role for the LNP in coalition with the LMB/JCB could
lead to calls for Barge to secede from the Libya. (Source Comment: The LNP is dominated by the former leaders of the
Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (AI-Jamala al-Islamiyyah â€”LIFG), who, according to sensitive sources, maintained ties to al
Qa'ida during their struggle with the forces of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi.)
6. Former interim Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril is leading the National Forces Alliance (NFA),
an umbrella coalition of liberal parties that received Western support for efforts to overthrow the regime of Muammar al
Qaddafi. While Jibril is not on the list of candidates, his presence in the NFA leadership is seen by Belhaj and other
Islamists as an effort by the United States and Western Europe to manipulate the election. Jalil does not believe that the
NFA can gain control of enough seats in parliament to play a significant role in the new government. According to this
source, Jalil believes that former Oil and Finance Minister Ali Tarhouni also plays an important role in the NFA.
7. At the same time, Jafil is watching the progress of a second moderate party, the National Front (NF), which is
based on the work of a 1980s-era anti-Qaddafi exile organization. The party is led by Mohammed al-Magariaf, an exiled
intellectual dissident leader from a prominent Eastern Libyan family. Jalil's sources advise that the NF is also backed by
the al-Sennusi tribe, the former Libyan royal family, who may be looking to play a role in a semi-autonomous or
independent Barqa. One particularly sensitive source noted that many of the NF leaders have ties to the United States,
Italy and the United Kingdom, and at one point Jalil believed that the NF might be able to work with the NFA; however,
personal differences between the leaders of the two parties made effective cooperation difficult.
8. (Source Comment: In the end, a particularly sensitive source stated in confidence that Jalil believes the
LMB/JCB will have a significant role in the new government, possibly supported by the LNP. However; he points out that
since accurate polling is nonexistent it is impossible to predict a victor with any accuracy. Jaill also noted that it is quite
possible that no group will win a clear victory, which, when added to the boycotts and pre-election violence may require
the NTC maintain control of the country for some time to come. Accordingly, he has instructed al-Juwali to prepare to use
the National Army to maintain order. For his part Al-Juwali has warned that this will be a difficult task since the best units
of the Army, including many of its armored forces are deployed in the Kufra region of the Southeast, in an effort to control
tribal conflicts, stem the flow of weapons into the country from South Sudan, and resist Qaddafi loyalists amongst the
nomadic tribes of the region.)

European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1. As of the morning of July 6, an individual with access to the information stated in confidence that Libyan National
Transitional Council (NTC) President Mustafa Abdel Jalil remains committed to a transfer of power to a popularly elected
government; however, he is prepared to ex-tend the life of the NTC as a guarantor of stability for the Libyan people
following the July 7, 2012 election for seats in a 200-member General National Congress (GNC). Jaifi realizes that 2.7
million Libyans have registered to vote and are generally anxious to replace the increasingly unpopular NTC. That said,
JAI expects the voting to lead to a period of confusion and he will not abandon his authority until the results are fixed.
2. Jalil is also frustrated by the fact that during its eight-month tenure of the administration of Prime Minister Abclel
Rahman el-Keib - who was appointed by the NTC was unable to provide solutions for Libya's long list of needs: a
functioning justice system, a reconciliation process for officials who served the old administration, the disarming of
militia, building functional national security forces, rebuilding destroyed areas, and delivering basic services such as
healthcare.
3. At the same time, outside of the oil sector, much of Libya's economy is stagnant, and in the opinion of Western
security officials, lacks the government's go-ahead to restart public sector infrastructure contracts. In addition,
international advisers and foreign investors are reluctant to return to an environment where the government will not
sign long term agreements and cannot guarantee security.
4.(Source Comment: According to an extremely sensitive source, Jalil continues to believe that this chaotic situation
should not be surprising. He regularly points out that eight months is not a sufficient amount of time to build functioning
institutions from the remnants of the regime of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi. The old regime featured a
dysfunctional bureaucracy, idiosyncratic rule, and anti-institutionalism. Additionally, Jaill now re
Ializes that due to
pronounced incompetence and a lack of will to take unpopular decisions the el-Keib government also failed to make
progress in the few areas where it could have achieved meaningful change. The towns of Sirte and Tawargha are
representative of the situation in the countryside where people lost their homes in the conflict and have been living in
temporary camps with limited ability to register and vote in their home district. Jalil has been urged by contacts in the
French and Italian Governments to guarantee the rights of people across the country in particular, he has serious
concerns as to whether or not supporters of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi in his hometown of Sirte will be
included in the future political processes of the new Libya; if they are not allowed to vote by local militiamen. At the
same time, the fighting between Libyan Arabs and Tebta tribesmen in the Kufra area threatens to prevent any voting
there. Jalil has been warned that the NTC regulations now state that members of the National Army are not allowed to
vote or run for office, which is a disincentive for armed militia brigade members to become legitimate soldiers.)
5.This well informed individual believes that despite these flaws, the new government created by the July 7 election will
eventually have the mandate to take the difficult decisions that can create a reconciliation process. Jalil will work to
maintain order in this transition period, and finally reach his goal of creating a situation where the government can
rebuild homes and restore sufficient law and order; allowing those in Sirte, Tawargha, Kufra, and throughout the rest of
the country to live in their hometowns, establishing a situation where a true civil society can develop.

6. Jail!, in conversations with the leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood (MB), and separately with liberal leader Ali
Tarhouni, has acknowledged that the central government's top priority must be security and that the NTC has been
unable to provide it. That said, Jail! and Minister of Defense Ousarna alefuwali have pledged to provide 30,000 to 40,000
security personnel for election day to prevent similar incidents to the July 1 attack on Benghazi's election headquarters.

disrupt the elections. (Note: Under the current system Tripolitania will have 120 seats in the GNC, Cyrenaica (Barge) 62,
and Fezzan in the South 18.)

Subject: RE: Libya intel from S
Jake - Thanks for this. Tracks with what we are hearing about elections and the weakness of the interim govt. Elections
are going smoothly throughout most of Libya (Ajdabiya being the exception, where some ballots were sabotaged
requiring voting in some centers to be postponed for a few hours). Factoring in time to tally votes and process appeals,
the UN and the Libyan elections commission are anticipating announcing final results by late July. The expectation is
that the TNC will remain in power until the new congress is seated.
Sett McCain and I toured the new parliament this afternoon, where we encountered a TNC member, an engineer and a
couple of UN experts reviewing progress on the interior decor of the main chamber. They are racing to get the chamber
finished in time for the first session. The UN is offering technical assistance to the secretariat of the new congress,
ranging from parliamentary procedure to legislative drafting. They're even helping to plot out the choreography of the
first sessions.
The atmosphere in Tripoli is very festive. The gov't declared today a holiday and people are driving around honking and
waving flags and making peace sign gestures. We visited several polling stations where we found people patiently
waiting in lines (gender segregated) lvlcCain was applauded and thanked for his support wherever we went.

Re: Libyan election
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the highest levels of
European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1. Libyan National Transitional Council (NTC) President Mustafa Abdel Jalil expected the final days leading to the
July 7, 2012 national elections to be complicated and sometimes violent; however, according to a knowledgeable
individual, he is particularly concerned by the level of control exerted by regional militia's and political groups on the
electoral process. In the opinion of this individual, Jalil and his advisors believe that, given the level of suspicion and
frustration felt in the various parts of the country, it will be difficult for the new 200 seat General National Congress (GNC)
to establish its authority, draft a new constitution, and establish new national government. With this in mind, Jalil stated in
extreme confidence that the NTC may have to remain in power until the situation becomes stable and a new government
is firmly in place. That said he still plans to have interim Prime Minister Abdel Rahman el-Keib step down after the
election results have been certified. The NTC will then work with the GNC as it takes shape to choose a new Prime
Minister and Cabinet. Jalil would like to keep several ministers from the el-Keib government in the new regime,
particularly Minister of Defense Ousama al-Juwali.
2. According to this individual, Jalil wants to maintain a degree of security and stability in an effort to reassure
foreign businesses and banks that Libya will not descend into civil war and chaos. At the same time, the NTC must deal
with the regional issues that divide the country's three electoral regions: Tripolitania in the West, Cyrenaica (Barqa) in the
East, and Fezzan in the South. In the weeks leading up to the election the failure of the NTC to resolve these differences
has strengthened the federalist movement in Barqa while antagonizing the tribal leaders in the South. Both groups are
calling on their followers to boycott the election while the Southerners are calling for the National Army to withdraw its
forces from the area around the town of Kufra, where they are deployed to stop fighting between tribal militias. At the
same time, on July 1 federalist supporters attacked electoral offices in Benghazi, protesting the influence of Tripoli and the
Western region on the upcoming elections.

3. (Source Comment In the opinion of a knowledgeable individual, the division of the 200 seats in the GNC lies
at the heart of this matter, with 120 seats allotted for the Tripolitania, 60 for Banta, and 18 for the Fezzan area. At
present, the Libyan MUSlifIl Brotherhood (LMB) and its political arm, the Justice and Construction Party (JCP), are
attempting to mount a national campaign, receiving discreet advice and technic.al support from the Egyptian Muslim
Brotherhood (EMB). Withthis assistance, Jalil is convinced that the JCP is the party that operates most effectively
throughout the country. JO has established ties to the EMB, from whom he has learned that JCP leader Mohamed
Sowan and his associates are working with the leadership of the EMB.)
4, According to his sources, Jai believes that he can work with Sowan and the LMB/JCP; however, he is
concerned that Mohammed Morsi, the newly elected EMB President of Egypt and EMB Supreme Guide Mohammed
Bathe are focused on developing Egyptian influence in Libya. Jalil has been informed privately that these EMS leaders
want to establish a strong position in Libya, particularly in the oil services sector as part of their effort to improve Egypt's
economic situation. Libyan officials in Cairo and Jallfs own associates are warning him that the Egyptians may see the
NTC as a potential barrier to their effort and are advising Sowan to press for an early withdrawal of Jalil and the NTC from
Libyan politics. For his part, Jalil has attempted to avoided direct conflict with the LMB/JCP, focusing his attention, and
that of the el-keib interim government on trying to deal with the unrest in the period leading up to the national elections.
5. According to a particularly sensitive source, Jalil believes that Sowan will need the assistance of the Libyan
National Party (LNP), the Islamist group led by religious scholar All al-Salabi and former Islarnist militant
General Abdel Hakim Alamin Belhaj to gain enough seats to control the GNC. While there are significant personal
conflicts between Sowan and Bethel Jalii believes that the two groups could work together to gain control of the
government. In this case, Jalil believes the new regime would move quickly to oust the RITC, and establish a more
conservative Islamist regime. At the same time since the LNP is a Tn'poli based movement, Jalil fears that the tribal
federalists in Barge might react violently to them gaining an important role in the new government. Since the Barge
leaders are urging their followers to boycott the election, a strong role for the LNP in coalition with the LMB/JCB could
lead to calls for Barge to secede from the Libya. (Source Comment: The LNP is dominated by the former leaders of the
Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (AI-Jama'a al-Islamiyyah â€”LIFG), who according to sensitive sources, maintained ties to at
Oalcia during their struggle with the forces of former dictator !Muenster at Qaddafi.)
6. Former interim Prime Minister Mahmotel Jibril is leading the National Forces Alliance (NFA),
an umbrella coalition of liberal parties that received Western support for efforts to overthrow the regime of Nluammar at
Qaddafi. VVhile Jibril is not on the list of candidates, his presence in the NFA leadership is seen by Belhaj and other
Islamists as an effort by the United States and Western Europe to manipulate the election. Jalil does not believe that the
NFA can gain control of enough seats in parliament to play a significant role in the new government. According to this
source, Jalil believes that former Oil and Finance Minister Ali Tanhouni also plays an important role in the NFA.
7, At the same time Jalil is watching the progress of a second moderate party, the National Front (NF), which is

intellectual dissident leader from a prominent Eastern Libyan family, Jai's sources advise that the NF is also backed by
the al-Sennusi tribe, the former Libyan royal family, who may be looking to play a role in a semi-autonomous or
independent Barga. One particularly sensitive source noted that many of the NF leaders have ties to the United States,
Italy and the United Kingdom, and at one point Jalil believed that the NF might be able to work with the NFA; however,
personal differences between the leaders of the two parties made effective cooperation difficult.

possible that no group will win a clear victory, which, when added to the boycotts and pre-election violence may require

the National Army to maintain order. For his part Al-Juwali has warned that this will be a difficult task since the best units
of the Army, including many of its armored forces are deployed in the kutra region of the Southeast, in an effort to control
tribal conflicts, stem the flow of weapons into the country from South Sudan, and resist Qaddati loyalists amongst the
nomadic tribes of the region.)

the final days leading to the July 7, 2012 national elections to be complicated and sometimes
violent however, according to a knowledgeable individual, he is particularly concerned by the
level of control exerted by regional militia's and political groups on the electoral process. In the
opinion of this individual, Jahl and his advisors believe that, given the level of suspicion and
frustration felt in the various parts of the country, it will be difficult for the new 200 seat General
National Congress (GNC) to establish its authority, draft a new constitution, and establish new
national government. With this in mind, Jalil stated in extreme confidence that the NTC may
have to remain in power until the situation becomes stable and a new government is firmly in
place. That said he still plans to have interim Prime Minister Abdel Rahman el-Keib step down
after the election results have been certified. The NTC will then work with the GNC as it takes
shape to choose a new Prime Minister and Cabinet. Jail would like to keep several ministers
from the el-Keib government in the new regime, particularly Minister of Defense Ousama al-

and chaos. At the same time, the NTC must deal with the regional issues that divide the
country's three electoral regions: Tripolitania in the West, Cyrenaica (Barqa) in the East, and
Fezzan in the South. In the weeks leading up to the election the failure of the NTC to resolve
these differences has strengthened the federalist movement in Barqa while antagonizing the tribal
leaders in the South. Both groups are calling on their followers to boycott the election while the
Southerners are calling for the National Army to withdraw its forces from the area around the
town of Kufra, where they are deployed to stop fighting between tribal militias. At the same
time, on July 1 federalist supporters attacked electoral offices in Benghazi, protesting the
influence of Tripoli and the Western region on the upcoming elections.
3. (Source Comment: In the opinion of a knowledgeable individual, the division of the
200 seats in the GNC lies at the heart of this matter, with 120 seats allotted for the Tripolitania,
60 for Barqa, and 18 for the Fezzan area. At present, the Libyan Muslim Brotherhood (LMB)
and its political arm, the Justice and Construction Party (JCP), are attempting to mount a national
campaign, receiving discreet advice and technical support from the Egyptian Muslim
Brotherhood (EMB). With this assistance, Jalil is convinced that the JCP is the party that
operates most effectively throughout the country. Jalil has established ties to the EMB, from
whom he has learned that JCP leader Mohamad Sowan and his associates are working with the
leadership of the EMB.)
4.According to his sources, Jalil believes that he can work with Sowan and the
LMB/JCP; however, he is concerned that Mohammed Morsi, the newly elected EMB President
of Egypt, and EMB Supreme Guide Mohammed Badie are focused on developing Egyptian
influence in Libya. Jalil has been informed privately that these EMB leaders want to establish a
strong position in Libya, particularly in the oil services sector as part of their effort to improve
Egypt's economic situation. Libyan officials in Cairo and Jalil's own associates are warning him
that the Egyptians may see the NTC as a potential barrier to their effort and are advising Sowan
to press for an early withdrawal of Jalil and the NTC from Libyan politics. For his part, Jalil has
attempted to avoided direct conflict with the LMB/JCP, focusing his attention, and that of the el-
Keib interim government on trying to deal with the unrest in the period leading up to the national
elections.
5. According to a particularly sensitive source, Jalil believes that Sowan will need the
assistance of the Libyan National Party (LNP), the Islamist group led by religious scholar
Ali al-Salabi and former Islamist militant General Abdel Hakim Alamin Belhaj to gain enough
seats to control the GNC. While there are significant personal conflicts between Sowan and
Belhaj, Jalil believes that the two groups could work together to gain control of the government.
In this case, Jalil believes the new regime would move quickly to oust the NTC, and establish a
more conservative Islamist regime. At the same time, since the LNP is a Tripoli based
movement, Nil fears that the tribal federalists in Barqa might react violently to them gaining an

important role in the new government. Since the Barqa leaders are urging their followers to
boycott the election, a strong role for the LNP in coalition with the LMB/JCB could lead to calls
for Barqa to secede from the Libya. (Source Comment: The LNP is dominated by the former
leaders of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (AI-Jamala al-Islamiyyah â€”LIFO), who, according
to sensitive sources, maintained ties to al Qa'ida during their struggle with the forces of former
dictator Muammar al Qaddafi )
6. Former interim Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril is leading the National Forces
Alliance (NFA), an umbrella coalition of liberal parties that received Western support for
efforts to overthrow the regime of Muammar al Qaddafi. While fibril is not on the list of
candidates, his presence in the NFA leadership is seen by Belhaj and other Islamists as an effort
by the United States and Western Europe to manipulate the election. Jalil does not believe that
the NFA can gain control of enough seats in parliament to play a significant role in the new
government. According to this source, Jalil believes that former Oil and Finance Minister Mi
Tarhouni also plays an important role in the NFA.
7. At the same time, Jalil is watching the progress of a second moderate party, the
National Front (NF), which is based on the work of a 1980s-era anti-Qaddafi exile organization.
The party is led by Mohammed al-Magariaf, an exiled intellectual dissident leader from a
prominent Eastern Libyan family. Jalil 's sources advise that the NF is also backed by the al-
Sennusi tribe, the former Libyan royal family, who may be looking to play a role in a semi-

Re: New president of Libya
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council,as well as the highest levels
of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
I. During early August, 2012, Libyan National Transitional Council (NTC) President Mustafa Abdel
Jalil held discreet meetings with Mohammed Yussef Magariaf, the then leader of the newly elected General
National Congress (GNC), who Jalil learned was to be named interim President of Libya when the NTC stepped
down. During these sessions the two leaders worked out the transition to a new, elected interim Government for
Libya; focusing on the need to restore stability and security by disarming the militia units which fought in the
2011 revolution against former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi. According to a source with excellent access to
both parties, Jalil came away from the meeting convinced that Magariaf is intent on becoming Libya's first
elected president following the overthrow of Qaddafi. Jalil was pleased to learn that Magariaf strongly supports
the three-party Cairo Declaration negotiated between the NTC and the Governments of Tunisia and Egypt in
late July allowing for increased trade and a relaxation of existing travel restrictions.
2. According to this individual, Jalil and Magariaf agree that Tunisia and Egypt hold the key to Libya's
future economic success, with Libya providing the funding for new projects, while Egypt and Tunisia provide
technical expertise. Magariaf stated privately that this relationship marks a departure from the Qaddafi years
when Libya's natural resources fell under the control of foreign firms and governments. Jalil added that
Magariaf will welcome investment and cooperation from American and Western European banks and
corporations, but believes Libya, supported by the new governments rising out of the Arab Spring, must
maintain control over all aspects of the industries involved in exploiting its natural resources. In this regard,
with the support of both Jalil and Magariaf, the Libyan Ministry of Finance is increasing the level of Libyan
investment in the Cairo stock exchange. In turn, Magariaf and Egyptian President Mohamad Morsi discussed
increased Tunisian and Egyptian investment in the Benghazi stock exchange as the economic situation in Libya
becomes more orderly.

3. In commenting on the new Interim President, Jalil added that Magariaf s current position is bolstered
by the fact that he is not tied to any particular faction. At the same time he has maintained the respect that is
attached to his role as the first Libyan leader to direct an armed revolt against Qaddafi. This fighting was
carried out by the rebel Libyan National Army in 1981. Magariaf is an academic and diplomat with well
established Islamist credentials and good relationships with business and government leaders in the United
States and Western Europe. A separate sensitive source noted that one interesting issue to watch is Magariaf s
relationship with General Khalifa Belqasim Haftar, the commander of one sections of the new Libyan Army.
Haftar has been at odds with many of the militia commanders and is currently leading Libyan forces in the
Kufra region, attempting to end local tribal fighting and block the smuggling of arms and supplies to pro-
Qaddafi militias by supporters based in South Sudan. In the years between 1981 and 1990 Haftar (then Colonel
Haftar) commanded the rebel Libyan National Army, under Magariaf s National Front for the Salvation of
Libya (NFSL). One source notes that Magariaf s opposition to Qaddafi was based on the dictator's betrayal of
Islamic principles, a position that, at that time, was supported by the Western Allies.
4. According to this individual, Jalil also spoke with former Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril, who
indicated that he and Magariaf agree on many issues, including the belief that they can build an Islamic state in
Libya that can function in the world economy and the international diplomatic community. He did note that he
believes Magariaf s view of the role of Islam in the day to day function of the government is more conservative
than his, but these are differences that can be sorted out in the GNC. In the opinion of this individual Jabril is
well aware of the fact that, while his National Force Alliance (NFA) controls a solid bloc of thirty nine (39)
seats in the GNC and Magariaf's National Front Party (NFP) holds no seats in its own right, the interim
President has established good working relationships with at least 100 of the 120 independent members of the
GNC. Magariaf received 113 votes in his election as Interim President. Again these independent deputies
respect Magariaf s role in fighting the Qaddafi regime.
5.(Source Comment: This particularly sensitive individual stated in strict confidence that Magariaf sees
his role as establishing an efficient interim government, while overseeing the drafting of a new constitution and
election law. This individual believes that Magariaf is very interested in winning the presidency under this new
law. Besides meeting with Jalil and Jibril, Magariaf is talking to liberal politicians including former Oil and
Finance Minister Ali Tarhouni, and the leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood's (MB) Justice and Construction
Party (JCP), including Mohamad Sowan.)
6. This individual adds that Jalil believes Magariaf will face a very difficult period as he addresses the
many issues left unresolved by the NTC and the interim regime of Prime Minister .kbdel Rahman el-Keib. Jalil
has been highly frustrated by el-Keib's inability to disarm the many militia units left over from the 2011
revolution against Qaddafi. At the same time he has advised Magariaf to move quickly in replacing el-Keib's
cabinet while deciding which ministers to retain. The new interim government is facing a problem of
lawlessness and attacks against foreigners, including representatives of the Egyptian Government; this at a time
when the new Muslim Brotherhood government of Egypt is reaching out to increase business and diplomatic
contacts between the two countries. According to a sensitive source, Libyan military intelligence officers
believe these attacks are the work of Qaddafi loyalists, while former NTC officials fear that they may be carried
out by dissident Islamist groups, frustrated with the results of the national elections, which many of them
boycotted.
7. (Source Comment: An extremely sensitive source stated in confidence that Libyan Military
Intelligence officers reported to Jalil and later Magariaf that a series of bombings in Tripoli and Benghazi
appear to be the work of Qaddafi loyalists looking to create tension between the Libyan and Egyptian
Governments. These attacks included the car of an Egyptian diplomat, which was blown up near his home in
Benghazi, a day after several deadly bomb attacks in the capital Tripoli. At the same time, a homemade bomb
exploded under the vehicle of the Egyptian consulate's first secretary Abdelhamid Rifai in one of the Tripoli's
most affluent neighborhoods. No one was hurt during this attack. Earlier in August, three car bombs exploded
near the Ministry of Interior in Tripoli, killing two people and wounding three others. This sensitive source

added that security officers arrested 32 members of what they describe as an organized network of Gaddafi
loyalists linked to the attacks. During this period, the Red Cross suspended its activities in Benghazi and
Misrata after one of its compounds in Misrata was attacked with grenades and rockets. In late July seven
Iranian relief workers associated with the Libyan Red Crescent were kidnapped by tribal troops still loyal to the
Qaddafi family. Security officials have no word on the whereabouts of these relief workers.)
8. According to this source, while the Cairo Declaration received a positive reception among Libyan
political and business leaders, it also created a drastic increase in the number of Libyan's applying for Egyptian
visas under the new, simplified process. This workload has created a backlog of applications, and in mid-
August, a group of Libyan nationals frustrated with the Egyptian visa process attacked the interior of the
Egyptian consulate in Tripoli. These Libyan applicants were angry about the time it was taking to receive visas
to enter Egypt and were demanding that the staff work past their stated hours of operation. A sensitive source
noted that a number of Libyans destroyed the furniture in the main waiting room and attacked the consulate.
The Magariaf Government has assured the Egyptian ambassador that additional security personnel will be
assigned to guard the Embassy, at least until the visa backlog is reduced.

future economic success, with Libya providing the funding for new projects, while Egypt and Tunisia provide
technical expertise. Magariaf stated privately that this relationship marks a departure from the Qaddafi years
when Libya's natural resources fell under the control of foreign firms and governments. Jalil added that
Magariaf will welcome investment and cooperation from American and Western European banks and

corporations, but believes Libya, supported by the new governments rising out of the Arab Spring, must
maintain control over all aspects of the industries involved in exploiting its natural resources. In this regard,
with the support of both Jalil and Magariaf, the Libyan Ministry of Finance is increasing the level of Libyan
investment in the Cairo stock exchange. In turn, Magariaf and Egyptian President Mohamad Morsi discussed
increased Tunisian and Egyptian investment in the Benghazi stock exchange as the economic situation in Libya
becomes more orderly.
1 In commenting on the new Interim President, Jalil added that Magariaf s current position is bolstered
by the fact that he is not tied to any particular faction. At the same time he has maintained the respect that is
attached to his role as the first Libyan leader to direct an armed revolt against Qaddafi. This fighting was
carried out by the rebel Libyan National Army in 1981. Magariaf is an academic and diplomat with well
established Islamist credentials and good relationships with business and government leaders in the United
States and Western Europe. A separate sensitive source noted that one interesting issue to watch is Magariaf s
relationship with General Khalifa Belqasim Haftar, the commander of one sections of the new Libyan Army.
Haftar has been at odds with many of the militia commanders and is currently leading Libyan forces in the
Kufra region, attempting to end local tribal fighting and block the smuggling of arms and supplies to pro-
Qaddafi militias by supporters based in South Sudan. In the years between 1981 and 1990 Haftar (then Colonel
Haftar) commanded the rebel Libyan National Army, under Magariaf s National Front for the Salvation of
Libya (NFSL). One source notes that Magariaf s opposition to Qaddafi was based on the dictator's betrayal of
Islamic principles, a position that, at that time, was supported by the Western Allies.
4. According to this individual, Jalil also spoke with former Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril, who
indicated that he and Magariaf agree on many issues, including the belief that they can build an Islamic state in
Libya that can function in the world economy and the international diplomatic community. He did note that he
believes Magariaf s view of the role of Islam in the day to day function of the government is more conservative
than his, but these are differences that can be sorted out in the GNC. In the opinion of this individual Jabril is
well aware of the fact that, while his National Force Alliance (NFA) controls a solid bloc of thirty nine (39)
seats in the GNC and Magariaf s National Front Party (NFP) holds no seats in its own right, the interim
President has established good working relationships with at least 100 of the 120 independent members of the
GNC. Magariaf received 113 votes in his election as Interim President. Again these independent deputies
respect Magariaf s role in fighting the Qaddafi regime.
5.(Source Comment: This particularly sensitive individual stated in strict confidence that Magariaf sees
his role as establishing an efficient interim government, while overseeing the drafting of a new constitution and
election law. This individual believes that Magariaf is very interested in winning the presidency under this new
law. Besides meeting with Jalil and Jibril, Magariaf is talking to liberal politicians including former Oil and
Finance Minister Ali Tarhouni, and the leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood's (MB) Justice and Construction
Party (JCP), including Mohamad Sowan.)
6. This individual adds that Jalil believes Magariaf will face a very difficult period as he addresses the
many issues left unresolved by the NTC and the interim regime of Prime Minister Abdel Rahman el-Keib. Jalil
has been highly frustrated by el-Keib's inability to disarm the many militia units left over from the 2011
revolution against Qaddafi. At the same time he has advised Magariaf to move quickly in replacing el-Keib's
cabinet while deciding which ministers to retain. The new interim government is facing a problem of
lawlessness and attacks against foreigners, including representatives of the Egyptian Government; this at a time
when the new Muslim Brotherhood government of Egypt is reaching out to increase business and diplomatic
contacts between the two countries. According to a sensitive source, Libyan military intelligence officers
believe these attacks are the work of Qaddafi loyalists, while former NTC officials fear that they may be carried
out by dissident Islamist groups, frustrated with the results of the national elections, which many of them
boycotted.

7. (Source Comment: An extremely sensitive source stated in confidence that Libyan Military
Intelligence officers reported to Jalil and later Magariaf that a series of bombings in Tripoli and Benghazi
appear to be the work of Qaddafi loyalists looking to create tension between the Libyan and Egyptian
Governments. These attacks included the ear of an Egyptian diplomat, which was blown up near his home in
Benghazi, a day after several deadly bomb attacks in the capital Tripoli. At the same time, a homemade bomb
exploded under the vehicle of the Egyptian consulate's first secretary Abdelhatniti Rifai in one of the Tripoli's
most affluent neighborhoods. No one was hurt during this attack. Earlier in August, three car bombs exploded
near the Ministry of Interior in Tripoli, killing two people and wounding three others. This sensitive source
added that security officers arrested 32 members of what they describe as an organized network of Gaddafi
loyalists linked to the attacks. During this period, the Red Cross suspended its activities in Benghazi and
Misrata after one of its compounds in Misrata was attacked with grenades and rockets. In late July seven
Iranian relief workers associated with the Libyan Red Crescent were kidnapped by tribal troops still loyal to the
Qaddafi family. Security officials have no word on the whereabouts of these relief workers.)
8. According to this source, while the Cairo Declaration received a positive reception among Libyan
political and business leaders, it also created a drastic increase in the number of Libyan's applying for Egyptian
visas under the new, simplified process. This workload has created a backlog of applications, and in mid
August, a group of Libyan nationals frustrated with the Egyptian visa process attacked the interior of the
Egyptian consulate in Tripoli. These Libyan applicants were angry about the time it was taking to receive visas
to enter Egypt and were demanding that the staff work past their stated hours of operation. A sensitive source
noted that a number of Libyans destroyed the furniture in the main waiting room and attacked the consulate.
The Magariaf Government has assured the Egyptian ambassador that additional security personnel will be
assigned to guard the Embassy, at least until the visa backlog is reduced.

Re: New president of Libya
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the highest levels
of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1. During early August, 2012, Libyan National Transitional Council (NTC) President Mustafa Abdel
Jalil held discreet meetings with Mohammed Yussef Magariaf, the then leader of the newly elected General
National Congress (GNC), who Jalil learned was to be named interim President of Libya when the NTC stepped
down. During these sessions the two leaders worked out the transition to a new, elected interim Government for
Libya; focusing on the need to restore stability and security by disarming the militia units which fought in the
2011 revolution against former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi. According to a source with excellent access to
both parties, Jalil came away from the meeting convinced that Magariaf is intent on becoming Libya's first
elected president following the overthrow of Qaddafi. Jalil was pleased to learn that Magariaf strongly supports

the three-party Cairo Declaration negotiated between the NTC and the Governments of Tunisia and Egypt in

2. According to this individual, Jalil and Magariaf agree that Tunisia and Egypt hold the key to Libya's

Re: New President of Libya
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the
highest levels of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.
1.(Source Comment: As the new interim President of Libya Mohammed Yussef el Magariaf is
determined to establish a democratic state based on Islamic principles. In the opinion of an
extremely sensitive source, Magariaf sees this moment as the climax his entire life's work. Having
first served deposed dictator Muammar al Qaddafi as a policy advisor and diplomat, in 1979 Magariaf
became disenchanted with what he saw as the cult of personality that Qaddafi was building for
himself while turning against the basic beliefs of the Islamist movement. Magariaf was member of the
Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood in his student days and remains a devout Islamist intellectual, albeit
one who believes that Islam can coexist and even work with the non-Muslim world, particularly the
United States and Western Europe. This source also believes that Magariaf is convinced that Libya,
with its great natural wealth, can become a leading player in North Africa, as well as the rest of the
Islamic world. Magariaf is particularly well disposed toward the governments of the United States
and France, based on past experiences with each during his struggle with Qaddafi. This source also
believes that he remains hostile to the government of Omar al Bashir in Sudan. In 1989 Bashir
overthrew Magariafs ally, then Sudanese Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi and expelled Magariaf and
his followers from Khartoum.)
2. According to the same sensitive source, Magariaf will also seek a discreet relationship with
Israel. Political realities in Libya at present will dictate that this relationship be handled in a low key
manner, but the new President of Libya shares many common friends and associates with the leaders
of Israel and intends to take advantage of this situation to improve the lot of the Libyan people.
Magariaf may, at times, be forced to make statements critical of Israel for his own political purposes,
but believes he and his associates have the experience and sophistication to manage this issue. At the

same time Magariaf intends to pursue aggressively the regional political initiatives begun by National
Transitional Council (NTC) President Mustafa Abdel Jalil. Magariaf will pursue the economic and
security cooperation set out in the Cairo Declaration of July 29, 2012 establishing a regional bond
between the new revolutionary governments of Tunisia, Libya and Egypt. This same individual notes
that Magariaf is aware of the fact that Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi sees Libya as a key factor
in Egypt's economic development; and the Libyan leader believes he can manipulate this situation to
the advantage of the Libyan people.
3. A separate sensitive source stated on condition of strict secrecy that Magariaf intends to
work with his security advisors to develop a plan for disarming the Islamist militias who fought
against Qaddafi, without arousing their suspicion. He believes that the most important step in this
matter will be providing the medical and economic services demanded by these militias in return for
disarming. Magariaf also believes that he can manage the political ambitions of Islamist leaders like
General Abdelhakim Belhaj, while preventing the growth of radical groups who might see Libya as a
base of operations and support. Magariaf and his supporters believe that his Islamist/anti-Qaddafi
credentials will allow him to manage these challenges, and if he can do so he will be able to win the
presidency outright in the first full scale national presidential election in the spring of 2013.
4. This source adds that, while avoiding direct involvement in the Syrian crisis, the Magariaf
government will support Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the rest of the nations calling for the end of
the regime of Basher al Assad. Magariaf harbors a particular sense of hostility toward Assad, who was
a longtime ally of Qaddafi, supporting him with equipment, intelligence, and advisors throughout the
revolution of 2011. Magariaf realizes that this stance will also bring him into conflict with Syria's ally
Iran, but does not believe Iran has a role to play in Libya, or the rest of North Africa.
5. According to an extremely sensitive source, in 1979 Magariaf, having become increasingly
disenchanted with Qaddafi, fled Libya for Khartoum in Sudan, where in 1981, with the help of the
government of Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi, Chadian leader Hissene Habre, Iraqi President
Sadaam Hussein, and several Western states, he established The National Front for the Salvation of
Libya (NFSL), dedicated to overthrowing Qaddafi and establishing an Islamic democracy in Libya.
Under the auspices of the NFSL, Magariaf also organized the Libyan National Army (LNA), based in
Ndjamena, Chad. The LNA was commanded by the Colonel Khalifa Belqasim Haftar, who is now one
of the commanding generals of the new Libyan Army. Under Magariaf s authority the Haftar force,
which numbered between 2,500 and 3,000 troops, fought several battles with Qaddafi's troops, with
mixed results. These attacks included a raid on Qaddafi's compound at Bab al-Aziza in 1986. The
LNA also maintained a 50,000 watt radio station in Ndjamena, broadcasting anti-Qaddafi material
into Libya. This radio station was supported by Western governments and Iraqi Military Intelligence.
6. The LNA's greatest success came in support of the Chadian Army under General Idriss
Deby, in their overwhelming victory over Libyan troops at the battle Ouadi Doum in 1987. This
victory forced the Libyan Army and Air Force out of Chad, and was supported by the French Air Force
and other Western personnel. Following the battle Deby became a national hero in Chad. In 1990,
with the support of Libyan intelligence officers, Deby, who had undergone military training in Libya
and France, rebelled against and overthrew the Habre Government. At that time Deby, under
Qaddafi's influence, forced the LNA to abandon Chad for Zaire, and eventually the United States.
Magariaf and Haftar both settled in the United States, and while the LNA no longer existed as an
effective force, Magariaf continued to maintain the NFSL as a political organization. In 2004
Magariaf and the NFSL joined the National Conference for the Libyan Opposition (NCLO), eventually
returning to support the 2011 revolution.

strict secrecy, Magariaf views himself as an Islamist politician who can work with both Islamic and

non-Islamic states, including Israel, if the relationships are properly managed. The Libyan President
also sees the current situation as vindication for all of the problematic experiences he encountered in
his long struggle against the Qaddafi regime. This individual believes that TvIagariaf intends to use his
reputation for integrity, commitment to Islam, and his ability to work with divergent groups to
establish himself as an effective interim President, and eventually the first elected Libyan Head of
State in mid-2013. Ma gariaf plans to draw on all political, religious, and ethnic groups to form his
cabinet, using his stature to form a representative government under the General National Council.)

become a leading player in North Africa, as well as the rest of the Islamic world. Magariaf is
particularly well disposed toward the governments of the United States and France, based on past
experiences with each during his struggle with Qaddafi. This source also believes that he
remains hostile to the government of Omar al Bashir in Sudan. In 1989 Bashir overthrew
Magariar s ally, then Sudanese Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi and expelled Magariaf and his
followers from Khartoum.)
2. According to the same sensitive source, Magariaf will also seek a discreet relationship
with Israel. Political realities in Libya at present will dictate that this relationship be handled in a
low key manner, but the new President of Libya shares many common friends and associates
with the leaders of Israel and intends to take advantage of this situation to improve the lot of the
Libyan people. Magariaf may, at times, be forced to make statements critical of Israel for his
own political purposes, but believes he and his associates have the experience and sophistication
to manage this issue. At the same time Magariaf intends to pursue aggressively the regional
political initiatives begun by National Transitional Council (NTC) President Mustafa Abdel Jalil.

July 29, 2012 establishing a regional bond between the new revolutionary governments of
Tunisia, Libya and Egypt. This same individual notes that Magariaf is aware of the fact that
Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi sees Libya as a key factor in Egypt's economic
development; and the Libyan leader believes he can manipulate this situation to the advantage of
the Libyan people.
3. A separate sensitive source stated on condition of strict secrecy that Magariaf intends
to work with his security advisors to develop a plan for disarming the Islamist militias who
fought against Qaddafi, without arousing their suspicion. He believes that the most important
step in this matter will be providing the medical and economic services demanded by these
militias in return for disarming. Magariaf also believes that he can manage the political
ambitions of Islamist leaders like General Abdelhakim Belhaj, while preventing the growth of
radical groups who might see Libya as a base of operations and support. Magariaf and his
supporters believe that his Islamistianti-Qaddafi credentials will allow him to manage these
challenges, and if he can do so he will be able to win the presidency outright in the first full sca'e
national presidential election in the spring of 2013.
4. This source adds that, while avoiding direct involvement in the Syrian crisis, the
Magariaf government will support Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the rest of the nations
calling for the end of the regime of Basher al Assad. Magariaf harbors a particular sense of
hostility toward Assad, who was a longtime ally of Qaddafi, supporting him with equipment,
intelligence, and advisors throughout the revolution of 2011, Magariaf realizes that this stance
will also bring him into conflict with Syria's ally Iran, but does not believe Iran has a role to play
in Libya, or the rest of North Africa.
5. According to an extremely sensitive source, in 1979 Magariaf, having become
increasingly disenchanted with Qaddafi, fled Libya for Khartoum in Sudan, where in 1981, with
the help of the government of Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi, Chadian leader Hissene Habre,
Iraqi President Sadaam Hussein, and several Western states, he established The National Front
for the Salvation of Libya (NFSL), dedicated to overthrowing Qaddafi and establishing an
Islamic democracy in Libya. Under the auspices of the NFSL, Magariaf also organized the
Libyan National Army (LNA), based in Ndjamena, Chad. The LNA was commanded by the
Colonel Khalifa Belqasim Haftar, who is now one of the commanding generals of the new
Libyan Army. Under Magariars authority the Haftar force, which numbered between 2,500 and
3,000 troops, fought several battles with Qaddafi's troops, with mixed results. These attacks
included a raid on Qaddafi's compound at Bab al-Aziza in 1986. The LNA also maintained a
50,000 watt radio station in Ndjamena, broadcasting anti-Qaddafi material into Libya. This radio
station was supported by Western governments and Iraqi Military Intelligence.
6. The LNA's greatest success came in support of the Chadian Army under General
Idriss Deby, in their overwhelming victory over Libyan troops at the battle Ouadi Doum in 1987.
This victory forced the Libyan Army and Air Force out of' Chad, and was supported by the
French Air Force and other Western personnel. Following the battle Deby became a national
hero in Chad. In 1990, with the support of Libyan intelligence officers, Deby, who had
undergone military training in Libya and France, rebelled against and overthrew the Habre
Government A.t that time Deby, under Qaddafi's influence, forced the LNA to abandon Chad.

for Zaire, and eventually the United States. Magariaf and Haftar both settled in the United
States, and while the LNA no longer existed as an effective force, Magariaf continued to
maintain the NFSL as a political organization. In 2004 Magariaf and the NFSL joined the
National Conference for the Libyan Opposition (NCLO), eventually returning to support the
2011 revolution.
7. (Source Comment: In the opinion of an extremely sensitive source speaking on
condition of strict secrecy, Magariaf views himself as an Islamist politician who can work with
both Islamic and non-Islamic states, including Israel, if the relationships are properly managed.
The Libyan President also sees the current situation as vindication for all of the problematic
experiences he encountered in his long struggle against the Qaddafi regime. This individual
believes that Magariaf intends to use his reputation for integrity, commitment to Islam, and his
ability to work with divergent groups to establish himself as an effective interim President, and
eventually the first elected Libyan Head of State in mid-2013. Magariaf plans to draw on all
political, religious, and ethnic groups to form his cabinet, using his stature to form a
representative goverment under the General National Council.)

1. (Source Comment: As the new interim President of Libya Mohammed Yussef el Magariaf is
determined to establish a democratic state based on Islamic principles. In the opinion of an
extremely sensitive source, Magariaf sees this moment as the climax his entire life's work. Having
first served deposed dictator Muammar al Qaddafi as a policy advisor and diplomat, in 1979 Magariaf
became disenchanted with what he saw as the cult of personality that Qaddafi was building for
himself while turning against the basic beliefs of the Islamist movement. Magariaf was member of the
Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood in his student days and remains a devout Islamist intellectual, albeit
one who believes that Islam can coexist and even work with the non-Muslim world, particularly the

Re: Magariaf and the attack on US in Libya
SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as
well as the highest levels of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and
security services.
1. During the afternoon of September 11, 2012 new interim President of Libya
Mohammed Yussef el Magariaf spoke in private with senior advisors, including the
members of the Libyan Muslim Brotherhood, to discuss the attacks by demonstrators
on U.S. missions in Tripoli and Benghazi. According to a sensitive source, el Magariaf
was shaken by the attacks, and gave permission to commanders on the ground for
security forces to open fire over the heads of the crowds in an effort to break up mobs
attacking the missions. During this session, a senior security officer told el Magariaf
that the attacks on that day were inspired by what many devout Libyan viewed as a
sacrilegious internet video on the prophet Mohammed originating in America. The
Libyan attacks were also inspired by and linked to an attack on the U.S. mission in
Egypt on the same day. At the same time, el Magariaf noted in strong terms that the
atmosphere that made fostered these incidents in Libya is the product of widespread
publicity regarding the security situation in the country between 2004 and 2010 and

the cooperation that developed between a number of Western Intelligence services and
the regime of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi.
2. This source added that el Magariafs advisors believe that this situation adds
to the President's growing concern over the unpredictable effects that will follow
current covert efforts by his political opponents to link him directly to foreign
intelligence services. According to a separate sensitive source, el Magariaf noted that
his opponents had often tried to connect him to the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency
(CIA) through the National Front for the Salvation of Libya (NFSL), a group
established in opposition to former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi, which el Magariaf
led in the 198os. In the opinion of this individual el Magariaf believes that he can
survive potential negative publicity in this regard, but if this situation continues to
develop in this manner it will complicate his efforts to establish an orderly
administration in the country. Again, he stated that the attacks on the U.S. missions
were as much a result of the atmosphere created by this campaign, as the controversial
internet video.
3. At the same time, this .individual noted that several of el Magariaf s advisors
share his concerns in this matter, pointing out that the return of Qaddafi's intelligence
chief Abdullah al-Senoussi for trial in Libya has heightened public interest in the
liaison relationships conducted by the CIA and British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS)
with Qaddfis intelligence and security services. These same individuals note that they
believe Islamist militia forces under the command of General Abdeihaldm Belhaj
captured files and documents describing this relationship from Qaddafi's offices in
Tripoli. This fascination with Western intelligence operations in Qaddafi's Libya is also
driven by Human Rights Watch (HRW) and its efforts to tie Western governments to
human rights violations committed under Qaddafi. In this regard HRW has
interviewed at least fourteen (14) individuals claiming that they were.turned over to
Qaddafi's forces by the Western powers. Belhaj is included in this group.
4. (Source Comment: In the opinion of a very sensitive source, el Magariaf s
enemies are .working to take advantage of his suspected links to the CIA at a time when
Western intelligence services are under scrutiny in Libya. They also fear that this
situation will only grow more complex as Qaddafi's son Saif al Islam Qaddafi and al
Senousi are brought before Libyan courts to answer for their crimes under the old
regime, particularly during the 2011 revolution. These individuals believe both men
will be linked to Western Intelligence during their trials. )
5. According to this individual, el Magariaf is working with the Muslim
Brotherhood and other Islamist groups to defuse this situation. He is particularly
concerned by the level of violence between Sufi Muslims and Salafists, and believes he
must maintain his reputation for impartiality if he is to defuse this growing problem.
As he works to organize the government, and disarm the militias, he cannot afford to
lose the respect and trust of the Libyan people, especially at a time when cultural

have taken central stage in the new Libya. This source adds that these religious
conflicts were largely unknown during Qaddafi's rule.
6. (Source Comment: This source added that the individuals interviewed for the
HRW report were former members of the Libyan Islamist Fighting Group (LIFG), an
Islamist group formed in opposition to Gaddafi's controversial interpretations of Islam.
These LIFG fighters fled the country in the late 1980s and went to Afghanistan to join
the fight against the Soviet Union while also gaining training and experience for their
own struggle. A separate source adds that messages to Libya from the CIA and SIS
were found among the Tripoli Documents published by HRW, indicating that the
United States and Britain were eager to help Libya capture several senior LIFG figures,
including its co-founders, Belhaj and Sarni al-Saadi.)
7. As Libyan authorities struggle to control the armed rings that refuse to
surrender weapons following last year's civil war, Salafis, who say Islam should return
to the simple ways followed by Mohammed, have established their own armed gangs in
post-Gaddafi Libya. They view Sufi practices as idolatrous. Since the start of the Arab
Spring uprising across the region, a number of Sufi sites have been attacked in Egypt,
Mali and Libya. Magariaf is determined to establish a democratic state based on
Islamic principles. This individual adds that Magariaf remains dedicated to the idea of
building a tolerant Islamic state in Libya. El Magariafs opinions continue to be shaped
by his experience with Qaddafi, whom he felt built a cult of personality in violation of
all of the basic ideas of Islam.

believes he must maintain his reputation for impartiality if he is to defuse this
growing problem. As he works to organize the government, and disarm the
militias, he cannot afford to lose the respect and trust of the Libyan people,
especially at a time when cultural clashes between followers of the mystical Sufi
tradition and ultra-conservative Salafis have taken central stage in the new Libya.
This source adds that these religious conflicts were largely unknown during
Qaddafi's rule.
6. (Source Comment: This source added that the individuals interviewed for
the HRW report were former members of the Libyan Islamist Fighting Group
(LIFG), an Islamist group formed in opposition to Gaddafi's controversial
interpretations of Islam. These LIFG fighters fled the country in the late 1980s and
went to Afghanistan to join the fight against the Soviet Union while also gaining
training and experience for their own struggle. A separate source adds that
messages to Libya from the CIA and SIS were found among the Tripoli
Documents published by HRW, indicating that the United States and Britain were
eager to help Libya capture several senior LIFG figures, including its co-founders,
Belhaj and Sami al-Saadi.)
7. As Libyan authorities struggle to control the armed rings that refuse to
surrender weapons following last year's civil war, Salafis, who say Islam should
return to the simple ways followed by Mohammed, have established their own
armed gangs in post-Gaddafi Libya. They view Sufi practices as idolatrous. Since
the start of the Arab Spring uprising across the region, a number of Sufi sites have
been attacked in Egypt, Mali and Libya. Magariaf is determined to establish a
democratic state based on Islamic principles. This individual adds that Magariaf
remains dedicated to the idea of building a tolerant Islamic state in Libya. El
Magariars opinions continue to be shaped by his experience with Qaddafi, whom
he felt built a cult of personality in violation of all of the basic ideas of Islam.

Statement on the Death of American Personnel in Benghazi, Libya
It is with profound sadness that I share the news of the death of four American personnel, in Benghazi, Libya yesterday.
Among them were United States Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and Foreign Service Information Management
Officer, Sean Smith. We are still making next of kin notifications for the other two individuals. Our hearts go out to all
their families and colleagues.
A 23. year veteran of the Foreign Service, Ambassador Stevens died last night from injuries he sustained in the attack on
our office in Benghazi.
I had the privilege of swearing in Chris for his post in Libya only a few months ago. He spoke eloquently about his
passion for service, for diplomacy and for the Libyan people. This assignment was only the latest in his more than two
decades of dedication to advancing closer ties with the people of the Middle East and North Africa which began as a
Peace Corps Volunteer in Morocco. As the conflict in Libya unfolded, Chris was one of the first Americans on the ground
in Benghazi. He risked his own life to lend the Libyan people a helping hand to build the foundation for a new, free
nation. He spent every day since helping to finish the work that he started. Chris was committed to advancing America's
values and interests, even when that meant putting himself in danger.
Sean was a husband and a father of two, who joined the Department ten
years ago. Like Chris, Sean was one of our best. All the Americans
we lost in yesterday's attacks made the ultimate sacrifice. We condemn this vicious and violent attack that took their
lives, which they had committed to helping the Libyan people reach for a better future.
America's diplomats and development experts stand on the front lines every day for our country. We are honored by
the service of each and every one of them.

be my last Congressional break.
All the best,

Subject: For the Secretary of State visit to Haiti
I enjoyed the opportunity to discuss the emerging potential that Haiti presents with the Secretary of State and
former President Clinton last night. I would like to take this opportunity to make a brief suggestion for Thursday's trip to
Haiti:
We discussed the catalytic role the United States could play in leveraging much needed private investment in
large scale job creation, for example through direct involvement of OPIC. In my report I pointed out that the port in Port-
au-Prince is the most expensive port in the Caribbean and recommended the opening of new private ports. Ports
remain a critical bottleneck to a job creation strategy both in garment manufacturing and agriculture. They also play a
pivotal role in ensuring that some of the complementary imports necessary for the proposed road construction projects
can enter the country both in the required quantities and in a cost-effective and timely manner. Elsewhere I have argued
that spiraling prices in construction booms often mean that available funds only go half way to the finishing line.
The Haitian authorities have already made inroads in addressing some of these inefficiencies and stand ready to
do more. In fact, Prime Minister Pierre-Louis noted in the letter to investors which was presented at the meeting with

Charles Rangel and garment entrepreneurs on Monday, that ""ISPS certification of port facilities and alleviation of
customs procedures"" are in progress. The meetings tomorrow may present an opportunity to emphasize once again
how central well-functioning, competitive ports are to attract foreign investors as part of the HOPEI! window and to put
the right transport infrastructure in place.

Congressman Berman called me yesterday in support of Bob King's candidacy to serve as Special Envoy for Human Rights
in North Korea. I know he has raised this with Rich too.
I've known Bob for a number of years, throughout his tenure on Tom Lantos' staff, and have high regard for him.
Enjoy the weekend,

i like virtually everything in the two-pager, and I do agree with Tom on the notion of elevating the ""national interest""
and security elements of this, both because those have become part of her ""brand,"" and also to help flesh it out in a way
that both gives it the widest reach, and also protects it from attack.
some ways to consider doing that might be to just ensure that the overarching description of it ""call out"" the national
interest/security reasoning at work - something like ""America has the opportunity and the responsibility to lead in the
creation of a network of principled partnerships that will serve our national interest, enhance our security and build the
capacity of people and nations to solve global problems and give everyone more power to reach their potential.""
(i inserted ""network"" of principled partnerships because i think it kind of alludes to both the diversity of the kinds of
partnerships as well as to the influence of technology on building them...not a ""must have"" but just a thought....in the
same vein, i don't know whether there might be an advantage in alluding to a network of ""pragmatic and principled
partnerships"" or ""practical and principled partnerships"" just to ensure it's got that pragmatism aspect of it sharply
inserted).

I like the substance and I might consider if there are ways to communicate, or more strongly affirm, some
elements that would be important for audiences to hear, including that this is an approach of leadership, self-interest,
and values. The values I mean are things like security, stability and building opportunity. Those pieces are in here, but
the notion should be clear that we are not ceding leadership, we are leading by building alliances and partnerships. And
we will always stand for what is right and the right to defend ourselves and our allies, but we are fighting as we always
have for shared values. Make sense? Tom

Hillary, I've been trying to get a couple of reasonably time-sensitive messages to you for a couple of weeks via Cheryl's
State Department e-mail, and I've heard nothing back. Is there a different channel I should use? Strobe
PS: here's the last one I sent, with an attachment of the earlier one
Cheryl, I'm resending a message that I first sent on April 14. I can imagine how flooded your inbox is, but I'd be grateful
if you could give me some idea of whether what I'm proposing below might work. If there's any chance, I'll send you the
full list of people from the Board and Intl Advisory Council.
BTW, I've heard terrific reports about the Sec's Town Meeting in Iraq yesterday, including from my friend
who I gather is slated to go to as ambassador. He's as good as they get.
One other thing (speaking of ambassadorships), I'm concerned about what I gather may happen with regard to the
Tokyo embassyâ€”not least because the Japanese are getting concerned. I realize the locus of decision-making there is
the White House, but given the terrific start the HRC gave to the US-Japan relationship by going to Tokyo first on her trip
to Asia, I'd be sorry to see any, setback there.
Here follows my earlier message....
Hi, Cheryl. I wanted to take a quiet sounding with you about possibly getting a bit of time for the Brookings board of
trustees and International Advisory Council on June 4. If there's any possibility at all, I'll come in, via any channel you
suggest, with a formal request, but here's the essence of it: we've got a very distinguished board which she's met with
before (a week after the 2004 election), plus a group of 20+ high-level international types
etc.). We could do it in a way that minimizes the imposition on her timeâ€”i.e., bring the group into the
department an assemble in the Loy Henderson auditorium (or whatever it's called these days, or a similar 1st floor
venue), and she comes down and talks to us for 15 minutes and take 15 minutes of questions, over and out. We did this

that it is their board mtg, they can't.
I do think it provides a useful oppor for her to engage an imp group post her BIG Speech but the first day after such a

Dear Burns,
It was good to talk with you again this morning. I am grateful for your willingness to help the Council of Bishops. The
following are dates and times that are available:
Sunday, May 3, 6:00 PM dinner - This is the opening dinner for the Council in which all of the bishops will be present. It
will be at the American University Katzman Arts Center (right on the Nebraska Circle).
Wednesday, May 6, 6:00 PM dinner - Again all of the bishops will be present. This dinner will be at the Bethesda Hyatt,
7400 Wisconsin Avenue.

Another option is on Tuesday, May 6, any time between 2:00 and 4 PM with a group of bishops who are available to
come to the State Department.
Also a group of bishops are available for breakfast or lunch Tuesday through Thursday.
Our first hope is either the Sunday or Wednesday for dinner.
You or someone on behalf of Secretary Clinton can call me at If you could call or email me today to let me

John and Burns, Great talking to you both this evening.
Burns, the United Methodist Bishops from around the world are coming to the Washington area for a weeklong
gathering of bishops. Bishop John is host and arranging their schedule. John can tell you more details ...
it would be wonderful if a time could be found sometime during the week
(Sunday-Friday) for Hillary to meet with the entire group of bishops (around 100 total) or at least the leaders of the
African bishops (perhaps a group of 10 or so).

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05758447 Date: 06/30/2015
John notes that the group can be flexible and accomodate Hillary's busy schedule. He suggests that there are a couple
of ideal evening opportunities where all the bishops will be present: this Sunday evening at 6 pm at American
University's Arts Center, or Wednesday at 6 pm at the Hyatt in Bethesda. There also is a Tuesday evening gathering and
reception with just the African bishops -- 7 pm onwards at AP Shaw UMC in SE DC.
If it is not possible for her to go to the bishops, I wonder whether it might be possible for a smaller group (eg, John, the
African bishops and a couple others) to come to the State Department for a meeting in the Secretary's suite or
conference room on the 7th floor. The Secretary obviously has a very busy schedule, but it might well be possible to find
20-30 minutes sometime during the week at the Department. (I haven't yet done so, but I will check the State Dept
website and see what her announced travel schedule is.)
I am happy to help however I can, though it probably is easiest if you coordinate directly. Feel free to copy me at the
above emails if I can be helpful. Here are your cell numbers: Bishop John's is
Burns's is
God's blessings to you both,

Subject: Some intel for you...
This is about Sri Lankan Govt and the Tigers...
I have a good source.
This was shared to me at my and Karen's Derby Party yesterday (can you believe the 50 to 1 odds winner?).
There was a meeting held with Geitner asked for and led by IMF... They told him you were intruding into his domain by
ordering/telling IMF to suspend funding to Sri Lakan Govt.
My take is that the people on the ground both with World Bank and IMF believe the Tigers need to be completely
defeated and any collateral damage inflicted on private people by SL govt in process is ok... They also believe Tigers are
better at propaganda than SL govt...
I have no idea what reality is... I know all about the conflict because there's been so much written over time but no idea
of reality on ground.
My point is that IMF/World Bank is hoping to get Geitner to intervene and they recently played to his sense of who is US
point person on IMF... So, that's what I know. I'll keep my ears open.

Holbrooke would like to attend the Kazakhstan bilat. Bill Burns will attend, as will the ambassador and Richard Boucher.
I recall that you thought it didn't make sense for Holbrooke to join the Menon bilat (which Burns also attended) so I

What can we do to help protect the Christians in Iraq as requested by Ken Joseph whom we saw in Baghdad?
JoDee Winterhof raised questions about how the PRTs and the language DOD uses about them are problematic for
NGOs like care.
Pls ask one of Holbrooke's people if they ever talked to Wolfgang Danspeckgruber at Princeton about building a railroad
in Aghanistan.
Also Dr. Arthur Keys at International Relief + Development wanted to talk w someone from Holbrooke's team about
development in Af.
I asked the Spec IG for Af Recon, Arnold Fields, to alert us to problems as soon as they can. I'm not sure how to formalize
this or even if it's appropriate. Let's discuss.
What are the ""Iran Watchers""?

Tom wanted you to know that he and Hector Morales just departed Jamaica after meeting with Caribbean foreign
ministers. Three main points:
--The Caribbean FMs welcomed discussion with Tom about the Caribbean security dialogue. Tom told them we would
go into more detail at the May 20 experts meeting in Suriname.
--The FMs look forward to meeting with S in San Pedro Sula at the OASGA.
--On Cuba, the FMs expressed sympathy with what we are trying to do, but want to hear more about next steps.

Madam Secretary-
I hope this note finds you and your family doing well. I've been following all of your activities over the last several
months. You are doing an incredible job, which I'm sure is a surprise to no one. I'm going to be in DC May 19-21. We
have our annual gathering out there with about 150 folks coming out from the Exchange. I know this is probably a long
shot at best, but we are having a dinner for our group at the Hay Adams on Tuesday, May 19 and it would be a
tremendous honor if you would come by and say a few words. If this doesn't work but you are in town, I'd love to stop
by for 5 minutes to say hello. Please let me know if any of this is possible. I look forward to seeing you soon.
All my best,

Cheryl:
In anticipation of our meeting tomorrow, below and attached are a timeline and deliverables as we discussed last week.
I am having a lot of fun. I'm working my tail off, which I enjoy. If demand is an indicator of performance, I think I'm
getting off to a strong start. I'm wound up about my concept of 21st century statecraft (and loved hearing those words
come out of HRC's mouth at NYU) and am wound up about the possibilities of government to people and people to
government communication as a way of revolutionizing statecraft and empowering people across the globe. I think this
can be a major part of HRC's legacy.
Anyway ... here's the requested content for your review:

CA/OCS and EAP/K held a one-hour conference call today with the families of the detained journalists. During the call, 1.4(D)
we briefed the families on the Swedish Ambassador's consular visit with Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee on May 15; B1
recent progress on efforts to arrange the release of the
two women; an update on the proposed letter from the Secretary;

B1
Media: Although the families have thus far shown restraint from approaching the media to publicize their story, they
are increasingly anxious in response to the DPRK's announcement of a June 4 trial date. They now feel that a media
appeal is necessary and would be helpful to their case, citing the public attention given the Saberi case. They are
considering doing interviews on Larry King Live and/or The O'Reilly Factor. 1.4(D)

Hilary,
You may know but for the last four years I have been working with the Qatari's and in particular with Sheikha Moser on
disability issues in Qatar and I have built up a good relationship with them
Sheikha Moser has approached me privately saying they are keen to get their relationship with the USA onto a more
positive footing and she was hoping for a ""women-to women"" one to one private meeting with you. She is happy to
come to Washington if you could make some time available.
Is this something you would be prepared o do. Sheikha Moser is someone who has real influence in Qatar and she has
made a lot of difference already with her education city and with the Shaffalah Centre for people with Disabilities in
which I am involved as the Co Chair of its Annual Disability conference. I am sure the conversation would not be
confined to these issues but would be about the US/Qatar relationship generally.

The email below from Sally Osberg, President of the Skoll Foundation reminds me that right after the Skoll Forum in
Oxford, I wrote Cheryl indicating your interest in meeting with Jeff Skoll. I sent another email on this and a couple of
other meetings I think important (Jacqueline Novogratz, Acumen) but have never heard anything from her. I really do
think it would be valuable for you to meet Jeff Skoll, and to talk with Jacqueline about Pakistan, in particular, but
Acumen more generally. Perhaps I should go through the public-private partnerships office?

Hi Jan,
I also write to share that I spoke with this morningâ€”he'd called early last week, but we finally connected
today. A real honor to be one of the folks Is seeking out for counselâ€”and one I don't take lightly! As you
undoubtedly know, he's been offered a new role in the Obama administration, reporting directly to Hillary, would
oversee Of course, I encouraged him to do it (as have most of his students,
and others). In our conversation, he referenced your talking to one another at the Skoll Forum, your describing the
opportunity posed by Hillary's leadershipâ€”which would open space for an alliance of visionary leaders to advance a new
development paradigm for engaging with the world.
As I thought about what I said to drawing upon my admiration for what another great social entrepreneur, John
Gardner, contributed in his role as Lyndon Johnson's Secretary of HEW, which gave him a major hand in designing the
Great Society and ushering in that great wave of civil rights legislationâ€”I also wondered about you: specifically, your
World Bank leadership role, and how you were able to leverage your entrepreneurial instincts and clear commitment to
seeing investments translate into on-the-ground change while navigating a very large bureaucracy.
r xpects to be in DC by Thursday, and my gut tells me he is on his way to accepting this extraordinary challenge,
with the goal of reshaping aid policy so that it serves those the U.S. most needs as alliesâ€”those billions of women, men
and children the world over whose hearts and minds can be won if they can eat, care for and support their families, find
real reason to hope. My hope, to be perfectly clear!, is that you will be a friend to as he navigates a system he has
challenged and finds ways to drive meaningful, sustainable change. I don't really know, but my sense is that your hand is
already at work here. I also shared with him that you were working on the possibility of Hillary's speaking at next year's
Skoll Forum; he immediately said that Hillary, he and you should go together. How amazing would that be???!!!
Finally, connected with ver Elizabeth Bagley's upcoming visit to the Bay Area; and I
will meet with her when she's out hereâ€”if you have any guidance, I'd welcome it: I'm sure you know her and have a
sense of what some possible connections might be.

Dear Margo and Jill,
I'm writing to see if you might help me secure a meeting with Secretary Clinton to talk about my ideas for a $500 million
Global Innovation Fund that invests in ""what works"" in international development and would complement the work
President Obama is doing with his domestically-focused Social Innovation Fund.
The world needs a new vision for development. This is the moment for experimentation and a new commitment to
innovation and change. The U.S. spent $23.5 billion on foreign assistance in 2006. If we experimented with just $500
million to invest capital and technical assistance in social enterprises focused on results, accountability and scale, we

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05758560 Date: 06/30/2015
could build real blueprints for change. At Acumen Fund we see so many impactful and promising innovations; the State
Department would be a powerful partner in scaling those successes.
A global social innovation fund would be particularly impactful in Pakistan. The U.S. may commit $11.5 billion over five
years to Pakistan, and it is critical that we look closely at how we might spend that money. In Acumen Fund's seven
years working in Pakistan we have found that models for change exist, and we have built a powerful community of
entrepreneurs and supporters within Pakistan. As you know we have invested in organizations like Saiban, which has
provided low-cost housing to more than 60,000. There is FMIA, a joint venture that has sold more than 30,000 health
insurance policies. And Kashf, a microfinance institution serving more than 300,000 poor women by making small loans
to help themselves change their own lives. The challenge is to grow these solutions from reaching hundreds of
thousands to the millions most in need.
I believe this kind of investment in Pakistan is the ""smart power"" that Secretary Clinton referred to in her speech at the
Global Philanthropy Forum. She has an incredible vision and Acumen Fund would love to find ways to support her.
Anything you could do would be truly appreciated. And do let me know anything I can do on this end as I feel a deep
sense of urgency and want to do all I can to contribute.
Thanks so much,
Jacqueline

Lee--
I'm very pleased this new challenge is working out so well for you and your family. And, until you're in Warsaw, I
would welcome any thoughts you may have about what I should--or shouldn't!--be saying or doing. Pls send anything
you might have for me directly to Lauren Jiloty, whom I have copied on this email. All the best.","UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05758564 Date: 06/30/2015

Yes--but I don't want to lose the Sri Lankan call for today since it's taken awhile to set up and is very important. So that's
the key.

Yes -- Stephens is in DC all day, we can work with Ops on the call. I don't think we need to push the Angolans more than
15 minutes so should be fine. Should I move forward and adjust?

AMS did not like any of this both for the substance and because she did not write it so we did not share it with you
today. Then I decided to share it with you anyway for any value it has for you.
Frame:
The world we live in today is inextricably interconnected. Together we succeed. Apart we fail. In the Obama
Administration, we will use smart power to advance to our shared security, shared prosperity and shared humanity.
In advancing our shared security, we seek to:
Reduce threat of violent extremism
Reduce the spread of weapons of mass destruction
In advancing our shared prosperity, we seek to:
Use development to create and sustain strong stable economies by:
o Focusing on women as essential for driving economic growth;
o Expanding access to food and the means to grow or buy it; and,
o Expanding access to quality education in developing countries;
Expand access to stable, affordable and increasingly clean energy sources
In advancing our shared humanity, we seek to:
Expand human rights and the conditions that promote respect for human rights

â€¢ Support the development of health systems that support healthier societies and confront the spread of pandemic
disease (e.g., AlDs)
How we achieve these goals:
We will advance these goals through shared responsibility and the application of smart power. America has the
responsibility to lead, but can only lead in partnership with others. Smart power means elevating and integrating
diplomacy and development.
DIPLOMACY:
Focus on priority partnerships:
Revitalized partnerships with historic allies EU, Japan, Korea, Australia;
Calibrated partnerships with China and Russia;
Cultivated partnerships: Brazil, India, Turkey, Indonesia, and South Africa;
â€¢ Targeted public/private and multilateral partnerships based upon the principles of variable geometry (i.e., focused
on the problem at hand).
Build strong partnerships by:
listening and mutual respect â€” which has begun already and will continue
â€¢ being accountable for the challenges we create and demanding that our partners are similarly accountable;
â€¢ focusing on government to people, and people to people connections using new technology to create buy in from
bottom up so shared responsibility is experienced on the ground and sustainable;
â€¢ eliminating the obstacles to cooperation that stand in the way of us achieve our goals (e.g., resolving Cyprus so
Turkey can enter the EU; engaging Iran to create greater accountability among EU partners if engagement fails)
â€¢ creating work plans to drive cooperation on our shared agenda: tasks, timetables and benchmarks for each
country
DEVELOPMENT:
Establish and implement against our critical priorities:
Women as economic drivers and social stabilizers;
Education as the gateway to economic opportunity and human rights;

MEDIA ACTIVITY
(SBU) Governor Richardson Interviewed on MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show: Richardson discussed his previous
humanitarian missions to the DPRK to retrieve detained Amcits as well as the current case. He praised the
Administration's handling of the situation so far. In particular, he said that the Secretary had been doing a good job of
emphasizing quiet diplomacy as the way to resolve the matter. Maddow made two inaccurate statements in the
introduction to the segment: 1) that the DPRK has only allowed one consular visit so far; 2) that indictment was
particularly concerning because none of the previous cases had ever gone to court. Richardson corrected the latter
inaccuracy. (EAP/K)

FYI:
I have now seriously reviewed 9 candidates (and explored a handful of others who, for various reasons, I didn't feel
would be what we were looking for). Two have accepted other jobs that were already on the table before I spoke to
them (and for which they were better suited). One I-
7who I love) has decided her legal future requires her to come B6
here in a capacity other than speechwriting, and I think she's right about that,
None of these candidates is over 32 years old. The best writer among them is the youngest â€“ 24. She is intellectually
extremely mature and the only professional writer in the group.
On the other hand,
she's extremely smart and an excellent writer.

I have two more candidates who are working on second rounds of mock speeches. I need to see how quickly and
effectively they grasp directions and feedback. Hopefully one of them will work out for us.
One other prospect materialized yesterday; am waiting to get a better feel for her suitability. I'm also re-mining
journalistic contacts to see if I can possibly find a more seasoned writer from a newspaper or magazine who wants to
make the switch to government. So far that has proven futile; the few journalists who I've reached out to were not
interested in coming.
Will keep you posted.

Hilary,
You may know but for the last four years I have been working with the Qatari's and in particular with Sheikha Moser on
disability issues in Qatar and I have built up a good relationship with them
Sheikha Moser has approached me privately saying they are keen to get their relationship with the USA onto a more
positive footing and she was hoping for a ""women to women"" one to one private meeting with you. She is happy to
come to Washington if you could make some time available.
Is this something you would be prepared o do. Sheikha Moser is someone who has real influence in Qatar and she has
made a lot of difference already with her education city and with the Shaffalah Centre for people with Disabilities in
which I am involved as the Co Chair of its Annual Disability conference. I am sure the conversation would not be
confined to these issues but would be about the US/Qatar relationship generally.

Brian, First, thanks for a nice family morning and for breakfast. Always fun, always interesting and always fulfilling.
Below is a sample of the kind of emails I sent to various people (studio heads; Dan Glickman; etc), which have started to
generate concern, interest and action. AJC is also active on other fronts, as well.
Just below the email you will find the news item which first called this abomination to my attention.
I hope you can enlist Hilary's support (and please give her my personal best). We need, for many reasons, to have the
US protest and condemn this outrageous boycott and to oppose the anti-Semitism inherent in it; cf Durban. The
organizers of the festival must be convinced to reverse themselves. This, because of the inherent wrongness of it and
that if it succeeds, it will encourage and motivate those who fomented the boycott to other, probably even worse,
action. For example, there is in effect or pending (I am not certain which) a UK-Israeli treaty on film production; we
should cut off at the pass any attempts to derail it.

Our Embassy in London does not yet have our Ambassador. The charge d'affaires is Robert Lebaron who I hope will
receive appropriate instructions from DOS. If he acts quickly, it is likely that other nations will follow suit; again,
compare Durban.
This is truly appalling and serious and I earnestly solicit your assistance with the Secretary, and through you my earnest
solicitation of her assistance.
With appreciation and love, Bruce
PS Naturally, you are free to share this email.
Dear Michael, This is disgusting and outrageous.
If you have any films in the festival or can lean on anyone else who does, please get them withdrawn. We would not
boycott the films of any other nation, even those we consider outlaws. Neither should they. And they should learn that
boycotts beget boycotts.
Thanks for whatever help you can be.

Edinburgh film festival bows to pressure from Ken Loach over Israeli boycott
Mike Wade
A row threatened to engulf the Edinburgh International Film Festival yesterday after it bowed to pressure from the
director Ken Loach and returned a Â£300 grant it had received from the Israeli Embassy.
'Sir Jeremy Isaacs, the former chief executive of Channel Four, accused the festival's organisers of making ""an appalling
decision"" and called on them to rescind it. Describing Loach's intervention as an act of censorship, he said: ""They must
not allow someone who has no real position, no rock to stand on, to interfere with their programming.""
The grant was intended to enable Tali Shalom Ezer, a graduate of Tel Aviv University, to travel to Scotland for a
screening of her film, Surrogate.
After days of protest against the award from pro-Palestinian organisations, Loach, an outspoken opponent of Israel's
policies in Lebanon and Gaza, urged filmgoers on Monday to boycott Edinburgh.
""The massacres and state terrorism in Gaza make this money unacceptable,"" he said. ""With regret, I must urge all who
might consider visiting the festival to show their support for the Palestinian nation and stay away.""
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05758579 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05758579 Date: 06/30/2015
The intervention brought an immediate capitulation from the organisers. In a statement the festival said it accepted that
Loach spoke ""on behalf of the film community, therefore we will be returning the funding issued by the Israeli Embassy"".
Sir Jeremy said that he was disgusted both by Loach's actions and by the capitulation of the festival organisers. ""Ken
Loach has always been critical of censorship of his own work, albeit it was many years in the past. The idea that he
should lend himself to the denial of a film-maker's right to show her work is absolutely appalling,"" he said. He was
""equally horrified"" that festival organisers should accept that Loach was speaking on behalf of all British film-makers.
Sir Jeremy worked closely with Loach in the 1980s when, as chief executive of Channel Four, he commissioned a number
of controversial documentaries from him. One, A Question of Leadership, was made in 1981 but never broadcast,
leading to accusations of political censorship from Loach. The irony of the director's present position was all the more
obvious, given the spirit of the Edinburgh festival, Sir Jeremy said.
""It must be good for cinemagoers at an international film festival to see films by Jews, Arabs, Israelis and Palestinians, to
the benefit of all,"" he said.
""I have admired the Edinburgh International Film Festival for many years and would like to think that this appalling
decision will be rescinded.""
Loach's acclaimed new film Looking for Eric has made him the toast of the Cannes Film Festival. It is, uncharacteristically,
a comedy, although its lead character is an authentic Loach creation â€” a Mancunian postman who goes off in search of
his idol, the footballer Eric Cantona.
Ezer's film makes no reference to war or politics. It is a romance set in a sex-therapy clinic. It won the audience award at
an international women's film festival in Israel recently.
Lord Janner of Braunstone, a Labour peer and former chairman of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said that he was
disappointed by the festival's decision. ""By banning the Israeli Embassy from supporting a film-maker the festival is
helping to exclude Israelis from British cultural life, something that is clearly unfair.""
Last night a spokesman for the EIFF said that although it had returned Â£300 to the Israeli Embassy, the festival itself
would fund Ms Shalom-Ezer's travel to Edinburgh out of its own budget

organizers of the festival must be convinced to reverse themselves. This, because of the inherent wrongness of it and
that if it succeeds, it will encourage and motivate those who fomented the boycott to other, probably even worse,
action. For example, there is in effect or pending (I am not certain which) a UK-Israeli treaty on film production; we
should cut off at the pass any attempts to derail it.
Our Embassy in London does not yet have our Ambassador. The charge d'affaires is Robert Lebaron who I hope will
receive appropriate instructions from DOS. If he acts quickly, it is likely that other nations will follow suit; again,
compare Durban.
This is truly appalling and serious and I earnestly solicit your assistance with the Secretary, and through you my earnest
solicitation of her assistance.
With appreciation and love, Bruce
PS Naturally, you are free to share this email.
Dear Michael, This is disgusting and outrageous.
If you have any films in the festival or can lean on anyone else who does, please get them withdrawn. We would not
boycott the films of any other nation, even those we consider outlaws. Neither should they. And they should learn that
boycotts beget boycotts.
Thanks for whatever help you can be.
Warmest regards. Bruce

Edinburgh film festival bows to pressure from Ken Loach over Israeli boycott
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05758605 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05758605 Date: 06/30/2015

A row threatened to engulf the Edinburgh International Film Festival yesterday after it bowed to pressure from the
director Ken Loach and returned a Â£300 grant it had received from the Israeli Embassy.
Sir Jeremy Isaacs, the former chief executive of Channel Four, accused the festival's organisers of making ""an appalling
decision"" and called on them to rescind it. Describing Loach's intervention as an act of censorship, he said: ""They must
not allow someone who has no real position, no rock to stand on, to interfere with their programming.""
The grant was intended to enable Tali Shalom Ezer, a graduate of Tel Aviv University, to travel to Scotland for a
screening of her film, Surrogate. â€ž
After days of protest against the award from pro-Palestinian organisations, Loach, an outspoken opponent of Israel's
policies in Lebanon and Gaza, urged filmgoers on Monday to boycott Edinburgh.
""The massacres and state terrorism in Gaza make this money unacceptable,"" he said. ""With regret, I must urge all who
might consider visiting the festival to show their support for the Palestinian nation and stay away.""
The intervention brought an immediate capitulation from the organisers. In a statement the festival said it accepted that
Loach spoke ""on behalf of the film community, therefore we will be returning the funding issued by the Israeli Embassy"".
Sir Jeremy said that he was disgusted both by Loach's actions and by the capitulation of the festival organisers. ""Ken
Loach has always been critical of censorship of his own work, albeit it was many years in the past. The idea that he
should lend himself to the denial of a film-maker's right to show her work is absolutely appalling,"" he said. He was
""equally horrified"" that festival organisers should accept that Loach was speaking on behalf of all British film-makers.
Sir Jeremy worked closely with Loach in the 1980s when, as chief executive of Channel Four, he commissioned a number
of controversial documentaries from him. One, A Question of Leadership, was made in 1981 but never broadcast,
leading to accusations of political censorship from Loach. The irony of the director's present position was all the more
obvious, given the spirit of the Edinburgh festival, Sir Jeremy said.
""It must be good for cinemagoers at an international film festival to see films by Jews, Arabs, Israelis and Palestinians, to
the benefit of all,"" he said.
""I have admired the Edinburgh International Film Festival for many years and would like to think that this appalling
decision will be rescinded.""
Loach's acclaimed new film Looking for Eric has made him the toast of the Cannes Film Festival. It is, uncharacteristically,
a comedy, although its lead character is an authentic Loach creation â€” a Mancunian postman who goes off in search of
his idol, the footballer Eric Cantona.
Ezer's film makes no reference to war or politics. It is a romance set in a sex-therapy clinic. It won the audience award at
an international women's film festival in Israel recently.
Lord Janner of Braunstone, a Labour peer and former chairman of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said that he was
disappointed by the festival's decision. ""By banning the Israeli Embassy from supporting a film-maker the festival is
helping to exclude Israelis from British cultural life, something that is clearly unfair.""
Last night a spokesman for the EIFF said that although it had returned Â£300 to the Israeli Embassy, the festival itself
would fund Ms Shalom-Ezer's travel to Edinburgh out of its own budget

The Uncommon Trustee
FROM ETHIOPIA TO L.A. WITH $150 IN HIS POCKET, DANIEL YOHANNES BRINGS A QUIET DETERMINATION TO HIS
TRUSTEE ROLE.
By Leah Arroyo
This article was published in Museum, July/August 2008.
Trustee. The word brings to mind a venerable patrician of senior-Nears, ""trusted"" to guide the interests of an
organization or individual with wisdom and perspective. Someone with old-boy or -girl connections, decades of expertise
and, especially, big bucksâ€”not to mention the ability to pry others away from theirs. Ascot not required, but it couldn't
hurt.
In certain ways, Daniel Yohannes of Denver is not your typical museum trustee. At 17, with $150, he moved from
Ethiopia to Los Angeles as an exchange student without knowing a soul. He immediately got a part-time job as a stock
boy in a clothing store and went on to support himself through high school, Claremont McKenna College and the MBA
program at Pepperdine. He began his banking career as a teller at Security Pacific Bank.
But in other ways, Yohannes is the very portrait of a board member. At 55, the president and CEO of M&R Investments,
a firm specializing in real estate, financial institutions and energy. A former vice chairman of U.S. Bancorp. A few years
ago he started a bank in San Francisco on the side. His board membership extends from the financial (a Fortune 100

company) and educational (U.C. Denver Business School) to community organizations (the chamber of commerce, the
National Jewish Hospital and Research Center, the Boy Scouts Council)â€”not to mention political service (chairing the
transition team of Gov. Bill Ritter, Democrat of Colorado).
And museums, a priority among the board invitations he has accepted. He served on the Smithsonian Institution's
national board for six years and is now a trustee of the Denver Art Museum (DAM), where he established the Daniel
Yohannes Family African Gallery. ""I get a lot of my inspirations intellectually and culturally through art and history,
primarily through museums,"" he says. ""So when I was asked to sit on the [DAM] board, it was just a natural fit for me.""
For all his success, though, Yohannes hardly gives the impression of a Type-A personality. Courtly, soft-spoken, with a
melodious accent paying homage to his Ethiopian roots despite his decades in the U.S., he is generous and unhurried
with his time in interviews. On the phone, he asks how you are, what you've been up to lately; told that an interviewer
just bought her first house, he chats for a few moments about how delightful and meaningful that purchase is. In
person, for a conversation at the AAM Annual Meeting in Denver last spring, he walked into a rather dreary
underground room in the convention center, suave in a conservative navy suit and warm in his greetings, politely
oblivious to the tables cluttered with the conference staff's walkie-talkies, office supplies and assortment of snacks. The
photographer got sent to the wrong room and his interviewer had to scurry the length of several football fields to find
her? No problem; he'd reserved plenty of time to talk. ""Take your time.""
And yet you can at times glimpse the calm determination of a man who gets things done and, moreover, fully expects to.
Vicki Sterling, the Denver Art Museum's assistant director, says that ""what was truly unique about working with
[Yohannes] on the African gallery was his ability to bring together people from outside the regular museum donor
community and get them interested in the Denver Art Museum."" When you ask him how he did this, who these new
museophiles were, you can almost hear him shrug over the phone. ""Friends of mine, people I knew,"" he says. ""They
contributed because I. asked them to."" He also shrugs off the question of how he fits all his commitments into his
schedule: ""I think as long as there's a desire to get everything done, it gets done."" Asked what he does for fun, he has to
think for a moment. ""That's a good one.... I walk, I play a little golf, do a little bicycling, sightseeing."" He also collects
art, particularly African works, inspired years ago by his travels, though ""only as a hobby."" Last but not least, he
cherishes spending time with his three children, two of whom live in the area, and was overjoyed to become a
grandfather in May (""She's beautiful,"" he beams).
You walk away from him with an impression of a quietly dynamic man who has more priorities than most of us but can
somehow bring extraordinary focus to each in turn. He says he was driven from the very beginning. ""It was my decision
to come here, not my family's. I've always been a very adventurous person, ever since I was a child, so I made a decision
early on that I wanted to make it on my own. I wanted to go to a place that provided that opportunity for someone like
myself, an immigrant. I could not find any other place but here in the United States that provided all of that
opportunity."" Perhaps later generations of his family will be more jaded about the American dream, but Yohannes
speaks of it with unembarrassed directness. ""For someone like myself, it's much easier to give to the community that
has given you so much.""
Fortunately, he sees museum leadership as part of that obligation.

Subject: Re: FW: Frame
I think this is very good. I really like the emphasis on security, which is part of her brand, and very relevant (I always
have in the back of my mind the possibility that great tragedy will strike again, so we need to prepared to deal with that
reality, should it come about some day).
I like combining that with the notion of prosperity and humanity, which together covers so much ground - from
economic development to human rights.
A couple miscl thoughts --
- in terms of promoting prosperity/economic development, might there be a reason to technological advancement
(giving people access to education and technological tools that can help them in terms of both education and access to
social networks and other avenues for advancement). You do reference education in the development arena, and in
prosperity, so that's good).
- there isn't much here mentioning democratization, freedom, etc. I know that is probably dicey given the multitude of
governments we want to partner with that aren't ready to talk that talk, but still think it needs to be incorporated in
some aspect of a mission statement.
- really like strong reference to women as a key to economic and social stabilization. That ties into her ""brand"" and into
a reality. I know when the First Ladies of Africa came out here to LA, one of the desires was to try to draw them into an
alliance that might transcend their own national differences and create cross-border force for positive change. A friend

of mine is one of the executives with the Hunger Project, whose CEO is a woman who focuses, too, on the way targeting
women can help alleviate hunger in ways that just dealing with men or generally cannot.
- really like that 'variable geometry' reference. This is kind of like 3 dimensional chess - strange and complicated
alliances need to be made to grapple with a multitude of cross-cutting challenges. This is calculus, not arithmetic.
- would like to be sure religions are involved here, vis a vis the various partnerships. It can be either a powerful force of
positive change, or it can get in the way of progress, depending on how it's used or abused, but to the extent allowed
Constitutionally, the power of religion should be encouraged in the direction of alliances and partnerships of progress.
- as I think about Kennan's ""containment"" doctrine a little further - in some ways it can be reapplied to extremism,
meaning that our goal should be to contain not Communism this time, but extremist ideology whereever it exists, and
just as Kennan supported, development is one of the ways to build those walls of containment around a dangerous
ideology. We want to contain extremist, nihilistic, violent ideologies and movements whereever they might take root,
and a good way to do that is to focus on development, on women, on technology, on education.
The power of diplomacy rests on two foundations. On the one hand, there is the reality and potentiality of military
force. Without having the capacity to defend, and to project force, diplomacy is inherently weak and ineffectual.
On the other hand, development is the other foundation upon which successful diplomacy can be built. It's the carrot to
the military's stick. And the State Department has an integral role to play in both the diplomatic and developmental
parts of that tripod (while also being understanding of, and when necessary supportive of, implementing the military
part).
The connective tissue of security, prosperity and humanity is, as you suggest, ""purpose,"" or more prosaically -
""morality."" Morals. It is immoral for people to live in fear, to be unprotected, to be subject to harm and death. It is
immoral for people's human rights to be violated, to not have access to education and heatlh. And it is immoral to be
denied the opportunity to grow, to create a better future for children, etc. To let, as Roy has said, every child to live up
to his or her God-given potential.
one last point - on shared humanity, perhaps protecting the natural resources of the Earth - environmentalism - should
be referenced along with health and human rights. It's part of the underpinning of our international morality and the
kind of partnership we need to solve global warming, etc.

UPDATE (May 29): is under consideration, but the appointment is not a done deal. Apparently he has been asked
to fill out a raft of background forms (one involves listing all the foreign nationals a candidate encountered over a period
of years, an endeavor that would take the length of Obama's first term).
- one people who follow the appointments process down here know is very much par for the course.

If we set the expectation now that the outcome is likely to not go our way, ANY alternative - even one kicking the can
down the road as Jake outlines below - would be seen as a significant victory.
And as an added bonus, it would be an opportunity to highlight your personal dedication to and prioritization of human
rights/democracy, which we've been criticized for since China.

As the conversation with these two ministers unfold, you might make the point that we have come a LONG way on Cuba
so far -- and it would be really unfortunate to jam or embarrass President Obama after all the steps he's taken, especially
since what we are seeking is an entirely reasonable result.
Agreeing to lift the 1962 sanction is a BIG step.

It was terrific to see you the other day for the photo shoot with the ambassador designees. Elaine and I are excited --
and grateful to you -- for the opportunity.
As we discussed, I am in the building, working out of the transition office as the confirmation process inches forward.
Elaine and I are busy gearing up but, as we discussed, I am happy to pitch in on specific projects or anything else if the
need arises. In the meantime, best wishes to you and your family.

Subject: Huff Post Renegade Excerpt
Of all his transition choices, none was easier to make, or more complex to execute, than Hillary Clinton as secretary of
state. Obama had long wanted his former rival on his team, no matter what his friends and aides said about her
aggressive campaign... His staff opposed the idea for the most part, arguing that Clinton would never be truly loyal. But
Obama was willing to leave the primaries behind, including his own strong feelings at the time. ""I don't hold grudges,""
he told his aides. ""I don't worry about the past. I'm concerned about what happens now. If she can help me and Bill
Clinton isn't too much of a liability, we should seriously look at this."" ...
Obama was under no illusion about the legacy of the long primary season. During one transition meeting, Obama said he
wanted to offer Clinton the diplomatic job. ""I'm really interested in pursuing this, but I know she has some hard feelings
coming out of this campaign."" Emanuel and John Podesta, the former Clinton official who ran the transition, assured
Obama that she was over those hard feelings now. Obama smiled and said, ""Believe me. She's not over it yet.""
His decision to offer her the job of secretary of state came surprisingly early. Well before the end of the primaries, when
his staff and friends still felt hostile to her, Obama decided that Clinton possessed the qualities to carry his diplomacy to
the rest of the world. ""We actually thought during the primary, when we were pretty sure we were going to win, that
she could end up being a very effective secretary of state,"" he told me later. ""I felt that she was disciplined, that she was
precise, that she was smart as a whip, and that she would present a really strong image to the world...I had that mapped
out.""
Recruiting and managing a team of rivals would not be easy, and Clinton came with her own set of issues. Chief among
them was her campaign debt, which she wanted eliminated before she took the job of secretary of state. Would the
president-elect go out and help her to do so? ""I'm not begging her to take this job,"" Obama told his senior aides. ""If she
â€¢wants it, I could help. But I'm not willing to go out in these difficult economic times to do a flashy fundraiser in
California."" As it happened, plenty of people in the Senate were begging Obama to offer Clinton the job. Obama's aides

believed that many Senate Democrats thought Clinton had extended her presidential campaign far beyond the point
where she had lost the election. Her negative advertising wasted Democratic money, threatened to undermine the
party's nominee, and suggested that she was disloyal to the party. They were unwilling to offer the junior New York
senator a position ahead of her lowly rank, and she stood little chance of becoming majority leader. ""There was a lot of
encouragement from inside the Senate to get her into this job,"" said one senior Obama aide. ""They wanted her out of
there."" ...
As for controlling the uncontrollable Bill Clinton, Obama's aides drew up a series of checks on his fundraising for both
Clinton Global Initiative and his work on HIV/AIDS across the world. But they really counted on Hillary to be the ultimate
safeguard - against both her husband and her own ambition. ""It's in her interests to keep him in line,"" warned one senior
Obama aide. Others in Obama's inner circle said the president-elect believed Clinton needed to demonstrate that she
was a team player and to shape her own career and legacy. ""There are plenty who don't trust her and think she still
harbors something,"" said another senior adviser. ""It's still potentially problematic down the road. Barack's thinking on
this is that it's not in her interests to mess with us. She can't win that fight internally and she's smart enough that she
won't want that fight publicly.""
Several weeks into the administration, even Clinton's internal critics believed the relationship was a success. ""They have
both worked really hard at it,"" said one senior White House official. ""There's a natural affinity and respect that ironically
grew out of being opponents. You get to know someone really well after all that.""

Dear Cheryl
Following a few discussions with Dick Gephardt - I have pleasure in laying out fairly detailed information about a
conference that is being held in Demark on 3-4 December 2009.
We have made the note reasonably in-depth so hopefully will provide you with sufficient background. The organisers of
the event which are ATP - the largest Danish Pension Fund and the Climate Consortium Denmark are being sponsored
and backed by the Danish government and they were very hopeful that Hillary would be able to be the key note speaker
at the conference for reasons that they have identified in the attached briefing document.
We were hoping to establish whether this event would be of interest for Hillary to appear and if she was available we
would then arrange for the formal invite to be sent out by the Danish Government.
If we can provide any further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact us.
With very Best wishes
Nigel

Sorry to flood your email, but I couldn't resist sending this to you from Ben Smith.
A year later, Hillary wins
A year ago today, the final set of primaries made official the foregone conclusion that Barack Obama had won the
primary, and Hillary Clinton lost it.
There's far too much going on today to dwell on an anniversary, but it does seem worth noting one particular piece of
news in its light: On the central health care policy debate of the Democratic Primary -- which was, to be fair, conducted
within a fairly narrow frame -- Obama appears to have conceded today to a Senate plan likely to more closely resemble
Clinton's.
In a dense, careful letter <http://www.politico.com/static/PPM118_090603_healthcare_ltr.html> to Ted Kennedy nd
Max Baucus, Obama offered his principles <http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0609/23298.html> for a health care
plan and conceded on a central point: He is now open to an individual mandate, which he campaigned against, and
which is now being talked about by Senators of both parties with the buzzword ""shared responsibility.""
Obama still backs a ""hardship waiver"" for people unable to afford the mandate -- which is consistent with the core of his
objection to the mandate. But what he cast as a principled difference of approach -- was the problem merely that
people couldn't afford insurance? or something more? -- seems to have been conceded.
Here's the relevant paragraph:
I understand the Committees are moving towards a principle of shared responsibility -- making every American
responsible for having health insurance coverage, and asking that employers share in the cost. I share the goal of ending
lapses and gaps in coverage that make us less healthy and drive up everyone's costs, and I am open to your ideas on
shared responsibility. But I believe if we are going to make people responsible for owning health insurance, we must
make health care affordable. If we do end up with a system where people are responsible for their own insurance, we

need to provide a hardship waiver to exempt Americans who cannot afford it. In addition, while I believe that employers
have a responsibility to support health insurance for their employees, small businesses face a number of special
challenges in affording health benefits and should be exempted.

CONCEPT NOTE FOR WORLD FOOD PRIZE CEREMONY
Thursday, June 11, 2009
This speech is an opportunity to signal the urgency of the problem of global hunger; connect it to an array of global
issues, including economic development, health and education, expanding opportunity for women, and political
stability; and declare the Administration's commitment to tackling hunger at its roots, through effective and efficient
collaboration with an array of partners.
Additionally, your remarks can point to a shift from past approaches by emphasizing the need to support local solutions
and focus on long-term sustainability to help people feed themselves and reduce the need for emergency assistance
down the road.
The speech could be framed as follows:
THE PRIZE AND PRIZE-WINNER
You can begin by announcing the winner of the 2009 World Food Prize, Dr. Gebisa Ejeta. He has a remarkable story:
born in a mud hut in Ethiopia, he got his PhD from Purdue University in plant breeding and genetics and developed
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05758705 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05758705 Date: 06/30/2015
strains of sorghum that are drought-tolerant, high-yield, and resistant to the Striga weed, which devastates crops across
Africa.
Outside the lab, he helped start the Sudanese commercial seed industry; developed systems to produce, certify, and
market hybrid seeds; and educated farmers about the use of fertilizers and soil and water conservation. And he has
trained and inspired the next generation of African agricultural scientists.
A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH: FROM LAB TO FARM TO MARKET TO TABLE
Dr. Ejeta's work reflects the breadth of this issue and the comprehensive approach needed to address itâ€”one that
connects the labs where new seed technologies are developed.., the fields where small-scale farmers labor to feed their
families and make a living.., the markets where food is bought and sold... and the homes where people get the
nourishment they need to thrive.
In many places, that food chain is broken. One billion people worldwide woke up hungry this morning and will go to
sleep hungry tonight. Chronic hunger threatens health, while making it harder for people to work and students to learn,
which in turn stunts economic development. Last year's food riots demonstrated that when food is scarce, political
stability is threatened.
To date, the world's primary response to hunger has been to send emergency food aid. While this saves lives, it is a
short-term fix, and we need a long-term solution.
The Obama Administration is committed to leading in developing a new global approach. We will support the creation
of sustainable agricultural systems in appropriate regions around the world, to increase agricultural productivity, create
jobs, strengthen economies, and protect natural resources.
We will do this not by imposing one-size-fits-all solutions, but by assisting countries in carrying out individual strategies
that meet their needsâ€”for example, through the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Plan. To facilitate
coordination and share best practices, we will seek to convene donor governments, multilateral institutions, NG0s,
private companies, foundations, universities, and individuals.
THE ANCHORS OF OUR APPROACH
We've identified seven anchors that secure sustainable agriculture systems. These will guide our approach.
â€¢ Increase agricultural productivity by expanding access to quality seeds, fertilizer, irrigation, the credit to purchase
them, and the training to use them.
â€¢ Stimulate the post-harvest sector by improving the storage and processing of food and improving transportation to
connect small farmers to markets.
â€¢ Maintain natural resources so the land can be farmed well into the future and we can make the right adaptations
for the changing environment.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05758705 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05758705 Date: 06/30/2015
Expand knowledge and training by support R&D and developing the next generation of agriculture scientists.
Increase trade so small-scale farmers in developing countries can sell their crops far and wide.
â€¢ Support policy reform and good governance, because sustainable agriculture flourishes in a,clear and predictable
policy and regulatory environment.
â€¢ Support women and families in agriculture. Seventy percent of the world's farmers are women, but most of the
programs that offer credit and training to farmers target men. This must change for agriculture to thrive. And children
must have nutrition to contribute to their communities' future.
A PREVIEW OF WHAT'S TO COME
In the coming weeks, President Obama, Secretary Vilsack and I will be reaching out to share our approach to global
coordination and agriculture in greater detail. We will seek the input, wisdom and guidance of those who have been
working so long in this arenaâ€”from the Congress to NGOs to academics to foundations to the private sector. The
President's conversations at the G-8 meeting in Italy in two weeks will address our approach, as well as my trip to Africa
in August.
Addressing hunger and food is essential to achieving economic recovery, stabilizing societies, and expanding opportunity
for hundreds of millions of people worldwide. This is why supporting sustainable agriculture worldwide will be a central
element of foreign policy in the Obama Administration.
CONCLUSION
You can circle back to the story of Dr. Ejeta to close. He represents the need for a multinational approach: born in
Ethiopia, educated in the United States, advised by Indian scientists, advisor to several African nations.

National Security Threats Posed by Climate Change and Our Dependence on Foreign Oil
Dear,
I've spent my entire life working to keep America safe. That is why I feel compelled to add my voice to the growing
number of senior U.S. generals, admirals, and veterans calling for immediate actions to address the alarming national
security threats posed by climate change and our dependence on foreign oil.
We import over half our oil from countries that are hostile to us. Last year, we paid over $255 BILLION to Middle
Eastern countries that are the primary funders for terrorists groups like Al Qaeda and to Russia and Venezuela.
The U.S. consumes more energy than any other country in the world, so increased U.S. fuel efficiency standards and
reliance on renewable energy will directly affect not only our own economic prosperity, but world energy prices as well.
That matters because when the cost of a barrel of crude oil increases $10, the Ayatollah Khamenei in Iran gets $15
billion more, Putin in Russia gets an extra $36 billion, and Hugo Chavez in Venezuela gets an additional $10 billion to
prop up his anti-American regime.
Furthermore, since the military is the largest energy consumer in the U.S., that same $10/barrel increase means DoD has
to spend $1.3 billion more on fuel, which is equal to the entire procurement budget for the Marine Corps.
But our reliance on foreign oil does more than fund our enemies. The droughts, famines, and rising sea levels caused by
climate change pose perhaps the greatest destabilizing influence the world will face over the next 50 years.
Forty percent of the world's population gets its drinking water from mountain glaciers that could disappear within
decades. Without forceful and decisive action, conflict will likely erupt among climate refugees competing for dwindling
resources and political destabilization will create ungoverned spaces where terrorists can flourish. These effects were
seen in Afghanistan in the 1990s and are currently being experienced in Somalia and Darfur, were genocide erupted
following the drying of Lake Chad, leaving 300,000 dead.
We must act now. A huge coalition of faith and military leaders have joined together to support efforts in Congress to
pass effective climate change legislation this year. We need you to add your voice to ours by taking 1 minute to
encourage your Member of Congress to support this effort. Please click here to email or call your Representative.

Was going to write earlier re Palau willingness to take the 17 Guantanamo Uighurs -- but see the story has now
broken. I am now representing Palau, primarily re extension of free association w/ the U.S. In touch w/Fried's office re
Uighurs. Big commitment for Palau since Chinese tourism was planned and its close geographically, etc. but their
premium is on U.S. relations (as sadly demonstrated by the loss of a Palauan in the U.S. Army in Afghanistan last week).
Also, just FYI now, I've been concerned that the Budget includes a far too low placeholder for free association
extension aid, $45-9 m over 10 years, although the aid is to be based on a joint review of need that will really begin with
a Palauan presentation Friday. (I think the number didn't reflect any rethinking by this Administration). The U.S. is to
respond in a month.

Kyrgyzstan rejects Obama ""cooperation"" offer
U.S. President Obama has sent a personal appeal to Kyrgyzstan proposing ways to discuss ""expanding cooperation"".
Kyrgyzstan will not reverse its decision to close a U.S. military air base which is used to supply American troops for
Afghanistan occupation, Kyrgyz Foreign Minister Kadyrbek Sarbayev said on Thursday. U.S. President Barack Obama has
sent a personal appeal to Kyrgyzstan proposing ways to discuss ""expanding cooperation"".
But Bakiyev's office said in a statement it had received a letter from Obama praising bilateral relations. ""Moreover,
Barack Obama expressed hope to further strengthen various forms of cooperation between the United States and
Kyrgyzstan,"" the statement said without mentioning the air base issue. ""The decision to annul all agreements on the
Manas military air base has been taken and there is no turning back on this,"" he told the 24.kg news agency.

Most interesting observation of the day, from
""A statistical analysis of the data issued by the ministry of interior suggests a perfect linear relationship between votes
received by Ahmadinejad and Mousavi with an r-squared value of 0.9995, a near impossibility in nature.This suggests
that the ballots were never counted or were abandoned after it was clear Ahmadinejad was going to lose. Statistically, it
is impossible to maintain such a perfect linear relationship consistently through all stages of vote counting. We would
expect variation as the votes were coming in, due to differences expected between the cites and the country side and
hetereogeneity amoung ethnic groups.This to me is the most concrete evidence I have seen""

The Settlements Facts
By Daniel Kurtzer
Sunday, June 14, 2009
Faulty analysis of the Israeli settlement issue is being passed off as fact. Charles Krauthammer's June 5 column, ""The
Settlements Myth <http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/04/AR2009060403811.html> ,""
is one example.
Here are the facts: In 2003, the Israeli government accepted, with some reservations, the ""road map"" for peace, which
imposed two requirements on Israel regarding settlements: ""GOI [Government of Israel] immediately dismantles
settlement outposts erected since March 2001. Consistent with the Mitchell Report, GOI freezes all settlement activity
(including natural growth of settlements).""
Today, Israel maintains that three events -- namely, draft understandings discussed in 2003 between Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon and U.S. deputy national security adviser Stephen Hadley; President George W. Bush's April 14, 2004, letter
to Sharon; and an April 14 letter from Sharon adviser Dov Weissglas to national security adviser Condoleezza Rice --
constitute a formal understanding in which the United States accepted continuing Israeli building within the
""construction line"" of settlements. The problem is that there was no such understanding.
The first event the Israelis cite is the 2003 discussions on a four-part draft that included the notion that construction
within settlements might be permitted if confined to the already built-up areas of the settlements. The idea was to draw
a line around the outer perimeter of built-up areas in settlements and to allow building only inside that line. This draft
was never codified, and no effort was made then to define the line around the built-up areas of settlements.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05758778 Date: 06/30/2015
Nonetheless, Israel began to act largely in accordance with its own reading of these provisions, probably believing that
U.S. silence conferred assent.
Second, President Bush's 2004 letter conveyed U.S. support of an agreed outcome of negotiations in which Israel would
retain ""existing major Israeli population centers"" in the West Bank ""on the basis of mutually agreed changes ...."" One
of the key provisions of this letter was that U.S. support for Israel's retaining some settlements was predicated on there
being an ""agreed outcome"" of negotiations. Despite Israel's contention that this letter allowed it to continue building in
the large settlement blocs of Ariel, Maale Adumim and Gush Etzion, the letter did not convey any U.S. support for or
understanding of Israeli settlement activities in these or other areas in the run-up to a peace agreement.
In his 2004 letter to Rice, Weissglas addressed the issue of the ""construction line,"" saying that ""within the agreed
principles of settlement activities, an effort will be made in the next few days to have a better definition of the
construction line of settlements in Judea & Samaria."" However, there never were any ""agreed principles of settlement
activities."" Moreover, the effort to define the ""construction line"" was never consummated: Israel and the United States
discussed briefly but did not reach agreement on the definition of the construction line of settlements. Weissglas's letter
also promised ""continuous action"" to remove all the unauthorized outposts, but Israel removed almost none of them.
Throughout this period, the Bush administration did not regularly protest Israel's continuing settlement activity. But this
is very different from arguing that the United States agreed with it. In recent days, former senior Bush administration
officials have told journalists on background that no understandings existed with Israel regarding continued settlement
activity.
Commentators also focus on the Obama administration's reiteration that a freeze must include the ""natural growth"" of
settlements. Krauthammer says that this ""means strangling to death the thriving towns close to the 1949 armistice line.
.. It means no increase in population. Which means no babies."" This is nonsense. No one suggests that Israelis stop
having babies. Rather, the blessing of a new baby does not translate into a right to build more apartments or houses in
settlements. The two issues have nothing to do with each other. Israelis, like Americans, move all the time when life
circumstances -- children, jobs, housing availability -- change.
The pattern of population growth in the territories actually undercuts the natural-growth argument. Since 1993, when
Israel signed the Oslo Accords, Israel's West Bank settler population has grown from 116,300 to 289,600. The numbers in
East Jerusalem increased from 152,800 to more than 186,000. This goes far beyond the natural increase of families
already living in the settlements. Inserting the provision of ""natural growth"" in official documents started with the 2001
Mitchell Report and the 2003 ""road map,"" reflecting recognition that the concept was being abused as a justification for
expanding settlements. The Obama administration is pursuing policies that every administration since 1967 has
articulated -- that settlements jeopardize the possibility of achieving peace and thus settlement activity should stop. This
does not diminish the Palestinians' responsibilities, especially their commitment to stop violence and terrorism and
uproot terrorist infrastructure. President Obama emphasized this in his Cairo speech. But Palestinian failures in no way
justify Israeli failure to implement their road map commitments with respect to settlements and outposts. It is time for
Israel to freeze all settlement activity and dismantle the unauthorized outposts.
The writer, U.S. ambassador to Israel from 2001 to 2005, is a visiting professor of Middle East policy studies at Princeton
University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs.

With reference to our letter dated June 19, 2009, on behalf of the Holocaust Survivors Foundation USA, Inc. (HSF), I
would like to state that based on conversations that took place in the intervening time period between Ambassador
Eizenstat and the leadership of the HSF, and the commitments he made to our leaders, we are no longer asking that he
be replaced as the head of the U.S. delegation to the Prague Conference taking place on June 26-30.
On behalf of all of the survivors for whom we have been fighting over the last decade, including tens of thousands in
desperate need, we wish Ambassador Eizenstat the best of success as the head of the United States delegation at the
Conference, as well as in the follow-up activities that we understand will occur on matters affecting Holocaust survivors'
rights and interests.

Re: So sorry!
David--
Thank you for your too kind words which were a greatly welcome addition to my healing and rehab. My word of advice
is to watch where you step and stay grounded!
It's an honor to serve the President w you and I'd enjoy spending some one-on-one time just comparing notes and
catching up in the next weeks. All the best, Hillary

Hillary:
I have hesitated to email because I'm sure you are being inundated with good wishes. But I just wanted to tell you how
sorry I was to hear about your injury. It sounded horribly painful.
I hope you will allow yourself to rest and recover. You are an all-star player, and we need you for the long run!

Dear Hillary,
John Solomon, Exec Editor of Washington Times and a close personal friend (and always fair to us as AP reporter and
later Wash Post reporter), has called about a Wash Times reporter who is being held by Iranians. He says Greeks have
good relations and he believes they are trying to help. He believes you are meeting with Greek Foreign Minister
tomorrow and hopes you can raise the issue with him - he may already know something about it. Any information he
knows would help family.
Hope you can do this -
And hope your elbow is better -

Spanish FM Moratinos has requested to speak with you today. Tom can give u verbal download but below are basic
points. Let me know if u want us to set up call
Points:
- We condemn the effort to remove Zelaya from office.
- We are working within the OAS and with our regional partners to resolve this situation quickly and in a manner that
restores democratic order.
- We appreciate the role Spain played in winning quick EU condemnation of the coup attempt.
- Our work is not done. Rebuilding trust among competing political institutions and reducing polarization within
Honduras will take a lot of work. We hope Spain will work with us and the OAS to ensure a restoration of democratic
order that will allow Honduras to carry through with it electoral timetable (presidential vote scheduled for November)
Note from tom:
Aside from the statements issued by the President and the Secretary, we have been working in the OAS Permanent
Council fashioning a consensus resolution mapping out a path forward, reaching out to regional partners ( I have spoken
twice with Salvadoran President Funes, and our Ambassadors have been working with other Central American leaders),
and working within Honduras to limit the damage to Honduras institutions.

- Our work is not done. Rebuilding trust among competing political institutions and reducing polarization within
Honduras will take a lot of work. We hope Spain will work with us and the OAS to ensure a restoration of democratic
order that will allow Honduras to carry through with it electoral timetable (presidential vote scheduled for November)
Note from tom:
Aside from the statements issued by the President and the Secretary, we have been working in the OAS Permanent
Council fashioning a consensus resolution mapping out a path forward, reaching out to regional partners ( I have spoken
twice with Salvadoran President Funes, and our Ambassadors have been working with other Central American leaders),
and working within Honduras to limit the damage to Honduras institutions.

TEGUCIGALPA, June 30 (Reuters) - An interim government set up after a military coup in Honduras said it will send a
delegation of politicians, business leaders and lawyers to Washington on Wednesday for talks on the crisis.
Roberto Micheletti, sworn in as caretaker president after leftist President Manuel Zelaya was toppled by the army on
Sunday, announced the mission after Zelaya traveled to New York and Washington to address the United Nations and
Organization of American States.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Congressman Henry Waxman, the powerful chairman the U.S. House of Representatives Energy
and Commerce Committee, has been hospitalized in Los Angeles for an undisclosed ailment, a spokeswoman said. The
69-year-old veteran Democrat from Southern California was not feeling well on Tuesday and was admitted to Cedars-
Sinai Medical Center for ""routine testing,"" the spokeswoman, Karen Lightfoot said. ""He's feeling much better now,""
Lightfoot said. She declined to disclose the nature of his ailment or how long he is expected to remain in the hospital.
Waxman, a member of Congress since 1975, was a leading co-sponsor of landmark climate change legislation passed by
the House on Friday.

Isn't a surprise since 5 years ago he removed his brother as official crown prince.
Basically he's not honoring his fathers dying wish but since constitution says it should be son (with brother as option) he
has clear authority to do it. I personally think this shows confidence in his position as he's not worried about an outcry
from his fathers loyalists.

The OASGA still has not started. The Argentine President has arrived, but Zelaya has not.
I am working this event from my home. We have Hector B6
Morales, Craig Kelly, and Dan Restrepo at OAS Headquarters.
As I noted earlier, we will almost certainly have a resolution that suspends Honduras. There has been some talk about
using the resolution to urge countries to impose economic sanctions. Honduras (Zelaya government) finally said no to
that.
We are also working to convince Zelaya that now is not the time to return to Honduras. We are trying to get Insulza to
talk with the Argentine president about this. Hector spoke with the Dominican president earlier in the day, who is also
weighing in on the side of sanity.
That is all for the moment. This will probably go very late.

Zelaya seems intent on returning. If no other presidents travel with him, Insulza feels under an obligation to

Tuesday in time to meet in the late afternoon. They are asking if it would be possible to have the meeting sometime on

San Salvador to the U.S. and that A/S Shannon indicated the Secretary had said that she would be willing to meet with
him tomorrow. They were wondering if they could give Zelaya a window of time for a meeting (see email below from
DCM in Sal Salvador). Please advise.
Thanks,
Courtney

At 1945, local NIC media aired footage from MGA airport of Zelaya getting back on plane. It appeared that FM Rodas
and Ven FM Maduro were also in departing party.
NIC president Ortega put Z on plane at airport, but did not go with him.
Footage was recent, if not live, perhaps no more than 20 minutes old.

Looping other members of SITREP spam -- Managua understands that plane with ousted HOND President Zelaya left
WDC at approx 1500 WDC time. Also understand that plane is expected in Managua at approx 1924 local. Understand
that a separate plane with Argentine Pres Kirchner and Ecuadorian Pres. Correa also left WDC this afternoon en route to
El Salvador.
NEW INFORMATION
About 45 minutes ago, Telesur had images of apparent pro-Zelaya supporters at the airport fence and trying to pull it
down. Security forces inside the airport compound re-deployed to prevent a breach. It seems they did use white smoke
or gas to deter protestor action. Telesur also reported that shots were fired into the assembled crowd and that one or
two people were shot and killed (no names or confirmation). Images of ambulances in crowd were visible.
It seems now that the fence has been breached and a handful of pro-Zelaya supporters move in and out of airport area
to pick up rocks and retreat (there is open, clear area inside fence, possible construction). Security forces have taken up
positions on tarmac, presumably to prevent further incursion.

With respect to Micheleti assertion that NIC troops have mobilized near the border, our NIC contacts, both in GON and
private citizens indicate that there has been NO/NO unusual NIC mil activity at border -- Las Manos or El Espino.
However, as of 1900 Saturday, border contacts at El Espino report that HOND military reinforced its presence by about
70 personnel, who remain at El Espino. We were told this happened at Las Manos as well, but have not yet been able to
confirm with our sources at that border location.

Saddam's rule 'better' for gay Iraqis
Investigating reports of the murder and torture of gay men in Iraq, Ashley Byrne found that some gays found Saddam
Hussein's dictatorship preferable to the threat of violence they face today. Some readers will find parts of his report
disturbing.
There has been so much news of death and destruction from Iraq that the position of sexual minorities is rarely touched
on in the mainstream media.
But stories of torture and murder of gay Iraqis, particularly men, have been emerging in the gay press for several years.
Investigating these stories for a BBC Radio 5 Live documentary, Gay Life After Saddam, I've heard a range of views about
the deteriorating conditions for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) people.
Some say the violence has intensified in the past few months. Others say killings run into the hundreds and have been
going on since 2003.

What is clear, and confirmed by separate evidence from various human rights groups, is that some gay men have been
subjected to appalling violent abuse.
One young Iraqi, Amil (not his real name) recalled the death of a friend: ""They found out he was gay and they killed him
and they chopped him like a lamb, it was awful.""
Another man (who wished to remain anonymous) revealed to Scott Long from the New York-based Human Rights
Watch, how his partner was kidnapped and killed.
""It was late one night when four armed men came to take my boyfriend from his parents' house.
"" They found out he was gay and they killed him and they chopped him like a Iamb""
Amil, a gay Iraqi
""They were masked and dressed in black.
""We found his body the next day dumped in the garbage, his throat cut out, his genitals cut off.""
Of all the shocking testimony we heard, a form of torture involving glue has to be the most awful revelation to emerge
from our investigations.
Human Rights Watch researcher Rasha Moumneh told us: ""We've heard stories of gay-specific torture where men have
glue in their anuses and they force-feed them laxatives.""
Gay men inside Iraq have been able to seek sanctuary in safe houses, thanks to the UK-based Iraqi Lesbian Gay Bisexual
and Transgender (LGBT) group, which manages them from London.
The documentary team were granted exclusive access to one of the homes on the outskirts of Baghdad, where we found
a 31-year-old transsexual man called Qasim (not his real name).
Qasim said: ""I'm scared all the time. I often think people are going to come in the night and take me because I am
particularly known as gay.""
All the LGBT Iraqis interviewed for Gay Life After Saddam maintained that life was easier for them when Saddam Hussein
was in power, from 1979 to 2003.
Some spoke fondly of an underground gay culture that flourished before the war in Baghdad.
But it was unclear exactly what Saddam's view on homosexuality was, and there has been some evidence to suggest that
the former dictator was acting to clamp down on sexual minorities in the latter years of his reign.
So who is to blame for the violence against LGBT people in Iraq?
Some blame militia, while other accuse religious leaders of stoking up hatred of homosexuals, though some clerics have
also recently condemned the attacks on gays.
The Iraqi government and police also deny that there have been any state-sanctioned killings or torture of homosexuals
in Iraq.
What is clear however is that gay people in Iraq have not been crushed.
He may be holed up in a safe house but Qasim is hopeful: ""I find the Iraqi prime minister quite good.

""I hope he can talk with religious leaders, change the constitution and punish and imprison the murderers.""
Meanwhile the refugee who runs the safe houses from London, Ali HiIli, lives in constant fear of his life after being sent
two fatwas, or Islamic religious rulings.
But he has insisted he will not give up trying to help gay people in Iraq.
""If I think too much that someone is going to get me and kill me then I know I'd stop what I'm doing.
""I have to continue because I really believe in the work that I am doing.""
Gay Life After Saddam was broadcast on Radio 5 Live, Sunday 5 July.

Subject: RE: Colombian President Uribe would like to speak with the Secretary this evening
My guess is that he is calling about Honduras. He, like many other leaders with an interest in Central America, is worried
that Honduras is slipping towards confrontation and violence. He probably does not think Insulza is up to the task. S
should be aware that Arias is prepared to offer his services. I spoke with the Costa Rican FonMin, who said the de facto
government has reached out to Arias, and that the Costa Ricans will be looking for a way to make the offer to Zelaya.
Uribe knows Zelaya and has some influence. Uribe might want to talk with Arias and offer to help move Zelaya in the
right direction. (Although Uribe and Zelaya come from different ends of the political spectrum, they are both ranchers
and love horses, and this has created some comradeship.)

A US Expo 2010 pavilion, after all. <http://shanghaiscrap.com/?p=3350>
http://shanghaiscrap.com/?p=3350
Filed under:Expo 2010 <http://shanghaiscrap.com/?cat=33>, Expo 2010 - US Pavilion
<http://shanghaiscrap.com/?cat=38>, US Politics <http://shanghaiscrap.com/?cat=28> â€” posted by Adam on July 11,
2009 @ 7:00 am
Coming at the end of a tumultuous week in China marked by earthquakes, riots, and continued economic uncertainty,
the news that the US had finally confirmed that its participation in Expo 2010
<http://en.expo2010.cn/a/20090710/000011.htm> (a/k/a, next year's world fair) didn't seem particularly significant.
And, with much of Shanghai's foreign correspondent corps preoccupied with more pressing news elsewhere in China, it
didn't receive much coverage. Fair enough, I think. However, insofar as the US pavilion â€“ or lack thereofâ€“ had become
an increasingly thorny diplomatic issue between China and the United States, the signing ceremony was an important
signal that some kind of resolution was at hand.
I've been following the mostly sad saga of the US pavilion for several months now, both on Shanghai Scrap
<http://shanghaiscrap.com/?cat=38>, and elsewhere <http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200904u/shanghai-expo-2010>
. And, until two weeks ago, there was absolutely no reason to believe that a participation agreement would ever be
signed. Shanghai Expo, Inc. <http://usapavilion2010.comh , a non-profit authorized by the US State Department to
fund-raise, design, build, and operate a US pavilion, had failed to raise sufficient funds to break ground. At yesterday's
signing ceremony, Beatrice Camp, the US Consul General in Shanghai blamed the underwhelming fundraising on the
global economic crisis <http://shanghai.usembassy-china.org.cn/071009.html> â€“ a point that was picked up by the
Chinese media <http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-07/10/content_11685418.htm> . No doubt, the economic
crisis played a role, but as Camp and others close to the US effort surely know, the other important factor was the
inexperienced and increasingly erratic trio running the non-profit Shanghai Expo, Inc. As recently as last month, one of
its members â€“ Frank Lavin, a former US ambassador to Singapore and Undersecretary of Commerce â€“ issued a press
release falsely claiming that the US Congress had ""adopted"" a resolution in support of the US pavilion
<http://shanghaiscrap.com/?p=3106> . This incident, and others like it, succeeded in alienating potential donors
(including major US corporations with operations in China), vast swaths of the US expatriate business community in
Shanghai, and â€“ most crucially â€“ members of the Shanghai government. For those of us following the events, the
question was no longer ""How badly will the US damage its relationship with China if it doesn't participate?"" but instead
became ""What's worse for US-China relations? Turning down Shanghai's Expo invite or continuing the current,
incompetent effort?""
The July 1 appointment of Jose Villarreal as Commissioner General to the US pavilion effort seems to have changed the
equation. A lawyer with ties to the Clintons, Secretary of State Clinton empowered him to oversee the US effort. He
didn't waste any time, either, arriving in Shanghai on Monday, and managing to pull of the signing on Friday. One person
familiar with Villarreal's role described it as the arrival of an ""adult"" to a chaotic situation that badly needed one. Indeed,
if there's one telling detail to the handful of official and press accounts of yesterday's signing, it's the total absence of
the Shanghai Expo, Inc. members from the official comments and photos (US Consulate coverage here
<http://en.expo2010.cn/a/20090710/000011.htm> ; Shanghai government account here
<http://en.expo2010.cn/a/20090710/000011.htm> ), none of whom live or work in Shanghai, anyway. If that was a
conscious decision, it was a wise one.
A final point. As Villarreal conceded, the US effort must still raise roughly half of its $61 million budget. I suspect that â€“
with Villarreal in charge of the effort â€“ reluctant wallets will become less so. Regardless, though, this raises a still
unresolved question: namely, what are the actual fundraising rules for the US pavilion effort? Back in 2007, the State
Department indicated that it would not sign a participation agreement with Expo 2010, Inc until all funds were raised for
a pavilion. Apparently, that ill-conceived policy has changed. I say apparently because, up until now, the State
Department has refused to release the ""action plan"" that governs fundraising and other rules related to the US pavilion
in Shanghai. As a result of this official intransigence, a Freedom of Information Act request has been filed to obtain this

Department's FOIA office, we can keep guessing until Thanksgiving â€” it's around then that they'll get around to releasing
the documents.

Subject: Palau offended by US positions
Below is the statement of very impressive Palau reps at the end of a session of required meetings on the next phase of
free association aid. FYI only, the Palauans were insulted by the nature and depth of the response to their proposal as
well as the content and the overall approach. They are even privately questioning the relationship. (This hasn't affected
their intent to take the Uighurs.) I will send a few further thoughts.
At the conclusion of yesterday's meeting, the Palau delegation caucused to discuss its reaction to the response of the
United States delegation to the proposals that it made in June in Washington D.C., and expanded upon in subsequent
communications.
While the Palau delegation has agreed to respond to certain additional questions raised by the United States delegation
on specific elements of the Palau proposal, and further has agreed to participate in certain working groups on specific
issues, the Palau delegation was deeply disappointed with the response of the United States delegation. The United
States delegation did not seriously respond, as required by the Compact, to the operational requirements of the
Government of Palau or to Palau's comprehensive and considered plans to achieve economic advancement and self-
sufficiency.
In light of the foregoing, the Palau delegation has determined that it must now return to Palau to discuss with President
Toribiong the next steps that Palau needs to take regarding the Compact. Thank you.

Dear Secretary Clinton,
Your assistant, Lona Valmoro, and I have been exchanging emails on trying to find a time to meet in Washington on July
30. I am hopeful something can be worked out. In the meantime, I wanted to take you up on your offer below and
provide you with a few thoughts on China prior to the upcoming SED on July 27-28. I send you this note from Beijing
(midway through a four-day visit) via Blackberry -- so apologies for any typos.
1. Mounting signs of social instability have intensified China's growth imperatives. Beijing insiders are very concerned
about the Xinjiang uprising; Hu Jintao's pre-G-8 exit validates those concerns. Coming on the heels of last year's
problems in Tibet, social instability can no longer be dismissed as an isolated occurrence. In both cases, my sources claim
growth shortfalls have exacerbated ethnic disturbances. China's recent fiscal stimulus -- especially infrastructure
initiatives in the West -- attempts to address this. Growth has long been modern China's antidote to the risks of social
instability.
2. A massive external demand shock dilutes the growth antidote that China needs to contain social instability. In fact,
the global recession adds a new risk factor to China's social instability equation. The government has confirmed reports
of over 20 million layoffs of migrant workers in export-intensive Guangdong Province -- a direct outgrowth of the
collapse of Chinese exports over the past year (from growth of +25% in mid-2008 to a contraction of -25% in May 2009).
Driven by a record capitulation of the American consumer -- real US consumption down by -1.8% over the past four
quarters (a 58-year record plunge) -- China's biggest source of end-market export demand has been hit with an
extraordinary shock. To the extent there is more to come on this count -- and that remains my best guess, although with
a less dramatic US consumption adjustment than we saw over the past year -- external demand pressures will continue
to undermine China's growth imperatives and feed heightened concerns over social instability.
3. China's stimulus package is a ""quick fix"" that can only exacerbate its already worrisome structural imbalances. The
focus of the stimulus is on its two most unbalanced sectors -- fixed investment and exports, which collectively account
for about 80% of Chinese GDP. Fully 72% of the RMB4 trillion fiscal initiative announced last November goes to
infrastructure. And there are aggressive incentives directed at exporters (i.e., tax rebates, ""buy China"" procurement
incentives, SME credit support, etc.). Moreover, there has been a huge push of State-directed bank lending -- the full-
year 2009 lending target was hit in mid-April! This latter initiative underscores the risks of deteriorating loan quality and
associated banking problems down the road. Meanwhile, despite public claims to the contrary, very little has been done
to stimulate the one sector in China that needs it the most -- internal private consumption. Social safety net efforts are
still puny -- the recent healthcare plan translates into US$30 per person for three years and the National Social Security
Fund only has enough assets to provide about $90 of lifetime social security benefits per worker! This forces fear-driven
-- or precautionary -- saving that, in turn, inhibits the consumer-led impetus a Chinese rebalancing urgently needs.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05758986 Date: 06/30/2015
4. All this points to an asymmetrical global rebalancing -- a very worrisome prognosis for a post-crisis world. Despite all if
our problems, the US is actually tempering its greatest macro imbalance -- excess consumption. At the same time, China
is unfortunately upping the ante on its two most unbalanced sectors -- investment and exports. Sadly, this could set up a
still unbalanced global economy for another serious accident in the not-so-distant future.
Sorry to have rambled so much. There is a good deal more to each of the points above -- but wanted to give you the
highlights ahead of the SED. Good luck with that -- and with all else that seems to be going on around the world. Hope to
see you on the 30th.

Dear Secretary Clinton,
Although I regretfully missed seeing you on your swing through Beijing earlier this year, I will be back in Washington on
July 30. Would love the opportunity to meet with you briefly and give you up update on my thoughts/ insights into China
and the rest of the region. The story is not quite as neat as it appears on the surface. Despite all the hype, this region
remains an export machine that should struggle in the aftermath of the crisis -- with important implications for many of
the global economic issues you are facing. I have had extensive meetings throughout the region over the past few
months and would welcome the opportunity to provide you with a first hand assessment.
One other note: I will be publishing a book in Sept! Oct, ""The Next Asia"", which digs beneath the surface of many of the
macro issues the region faces. It is generally constructive on the Asian outlook but lays out a number of critical

An area where you could save time and space (but I didn't try to change it) would be to shorten the parts where you talk
about Israel and Palestine and about Iraq and Afghanistan - it seems to me that those are tactical discussions of an

AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE: Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu has determined ""it made no
sense"" to press the U.S. for assistance, a senior
Israeli official said.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759019 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759019 Date: 06/30/2015
I really don't get it. On June 14, less than a month after his meeting with President Obama, Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu gave one of the most comprehensive, thoughtful and highly personal speeches supporting the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process of any Israeli prime minister in recent years, perhaps ever.
One would have thought his speech would have been big news in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere. Mr. Netanyahu for
the first time clearly stated he would support a two-state solution, albeit with understandable requirements to
guarantee Israel's security, despite leaving a different impression during last month's U.S. visit.
Yet, the reaction of governments and media in the U.S. and Europe was the functional equivalent of a tree falling in the
forest with no one listening. Where it was covered, the writing emphasized the cynical and focused on the half-empty,
rather than the half-full, glass.
So let's take a closer look at what could turn out to be a very significant, game-changing speech. It can be divided,
essentially, into four parts: personal, historic, diplomatic and economic.
The personal aspect of the speech deals with the issue of peace. At one point, Mr. Netanyahu spoke directly to the
Palestinian people: ""We want to live with you in peace, as good neighbors. We want our children and your children to
never again experience war: that parents, brothers and sisters will never again know the agony of losing loved ones in
battle; that our children will be able to dream of a better future and realize that dream; and that together we will invest
our energies in plowshares and pruning hooks, not swords and spears.""
And then he reminded Palestinians that for him and his family, peace and war are quite personal: ""I know the face of
war. 1 have experienced battle. I lost close friends. I lost a brother. I have seen the pain of bereaved families. I do not
want war. No one in Israel wants war.""
Mr. Netanyahu also spent time in his speech on history, but not to relitigate the ancient argument over who lived in
Palestine first or for the longest time. Rather, Mr. Netanyahu explained that the ""root of the conflict"" has been based on
a fundamental misstatement of undeniable historical facts.
Palestinians have been taught that Israel was founded largely by alien foreigners, foisted on the native Palestinians by
Europeans feeling guilty over the Holocaust. That misstatement has been the central rationale for Arab and Palestinian
unwillingness to publicly recognize Israel as a Jewish state.
In fact, he points out, ""the attacks against us began in the 1920s,"" 20 years before the Holocaust. And the undeniable
historical fact is that ""the Jewish people and the land of Israel go back over 3,500 years"" - when Abraham, Isaac and
Jacob, forefathers of all Jews; David and Solomon, ancient Israel's two greatest kings; and Isaiah and Jeremiah, two of

the Jewish religion's greatest spiritual prophets, all lived in what was then Judea and Samaria, which today is called the
West Bank.
""The right of the Jewish people to a state in the land of Israel does not derive from the cascade of catastrophes that
befell our people,"" the prime minister said. ""There are those who say that if the Holocaust had not occurred, the state of
Israel would never have been established. But I say if the state of Israel would have been established earlier, it is the
Holocaust that would not have occurred.""
Third, the prime minister addressed the two simple requirements for peace between Israel and the Palestinians:
recognition and security.
As to the first, he put it quite simply: ""A fundamental prerequisite for ending the conflict is a public, binding and
unequivocal Palestinian recognition of Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people.""
As to the security, it is also quite simple: Palestine must be demilitarized, as guaranteed by the international community,
with open skies, no military alliances with hostile powers, and ""effective security measures to prevent weapons
smuggling into the territory - real monitoring, and not what occurs in Gaza today.""
Once these two issues of recognition and security for Israel have been guaranteed, the rest of the difficult issues seem
to come much easier: no more new settlements, with some wiggle room for the natural growth of current settlements
caused by families growing; equitable treatment and assistance in placing refugees in land and homes outside of Israel
(to preserve the essence of historic Israel as a Jewish state).
And on the always controversial issue of Jerusalem, Mr. Netanyahu was deftly ambiguous: ""Jerusalem, the capital of
Israel, must remain undivided, with continued religious freedom for all faiths."" That does not seem to exclude
Palestinian de facto control over certain parts of Jerusalem and certainly over their holy places.
Finally, the prime minister expressed a clear and concrete vision of economic prosperity for Palestinians in partnership
with Israel. Indeed, he stated that such economic prosperity can come even before a final peace agreement is reached.
""An economic peace is not a substitute for a political peace but an important element in achieving it. Together we can
undertake projects that overcome the scarcities of our region, like water desalination, or maximize its advantages, like
developing solar energy, and exploiting our geographic location by laying gas and petroleum lines and establishing
transportation links between Asia, Africa and Europe....

""Together we can develop industrial areas that will generate thousands of jobs and develop tourist sites that will attract
millions of visitors eager to walk in the footsteps of history - in Nazareth and in Bethlehem, around the walls of Jericho
and the walls of Jerusalem, on the banks of the Sea of Galilee, and the baptismal site on the banks of the Jordan.""
Who cannot be moved by these words? Perhaps Mr. Netanyahu has it right - a new sequencing of the peace process:
First, economic partnership and prosperity between Israelis and Palestinians; and then peace, not the other way around.
It could not have been by accident that Mr. Netanyahu chose to deliver his remarkable speech at the Begin-Sadat Center
at Bar-Ilan University. It was slightly more than 30 years ago, on March 26, 1979, that Prime Minister Menachem Begin,
as the leader of the right-wing Likud or ""Consolidation"" Party, joined with Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and signed a
historic peace agreement between Israel and Egypt.
Now another man of the right, another Likud prime minister some three decades later, seems poised to make the lasting
peace between Israel and Palestinians that has so long eluded his predecessors.
One wonders whether Mr. Netanyahu might also be thinking: If Richard Nixon could go to China because of a base on
the right that trusted him, then I can bring peace and prosperity between Israelis and Palestinians.
Let's hope - and pray - that he is right.

Dear Cheryl,
Congratulations on the launch of the $20b G8 initiative. This will stand as a historic success of President Obama and
Secretary Clinton. Please do convey my personal congratulations and gratitude to Secretary Clinton if you have a
moment to do so. I know what a key role you personally played in bringing this to fruition.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759025 Date: 06/30/2015
I would like to suggest one overarching strategy for success.
Please do push hard on the donors (USAID included!) to pool the donor resources into one, at most two, multilateral
funding streams. Certainly the World Bank should be the main spigot, and IFAD possibly a second. By pooling the
resources, we'll cut down BY YEARS on the delays, donor negotiations, further talk, report writing, expert trips, etc., etc.,
which are now the biggest single threat to success of the initiative.
I look forward to a few minutes by phone or in person to offer some tips coming from long years of experience in this
sphere. This can be a real historic path-breaker, if it's not swallowed in the agencies!
Warm regards and kudos!
Jeff Sachs

Subject: Palau offended by US positions
Below is the statement of very impressive Palau reps at the end of a session of required meetings on the next phase of
free association aid. FYI only, the Palauans were insulted by the nature and depth of the response to their proposal as
well as the content and the overall approach. They are even privately questioning the relationship. (This hasn't affected
their intent to take the Uighurs.) I will send a few further thoughts.
At the conclusion of yesterday's meeting, the Palau delegation caucused to discuss its reaction to the response of the
United States delegation to the proposals that it made in June in Washington D.C., and expanded upon in subsequent
communications.
While the Palau delegation has agreed to respond to certain additional questions raised by the United States delegation
on specific elements of the Palau proposal, and further has agreed to participate in certain working groups on specific
issues, the Palau delegation was deeply disappointed with the response of the United States delegation. The United
States delegation did not seriously respond, as required by the Compact, to the operational requirements of the
Government of Palau or to Palau's comprehensive and considered plans to achieve economic advancement and self-
sufficiency.
In light of the foregoing, the Palau delegation has determined that it must now return to Palau to discuss with President
Toribiong the next steps that Palau needs to take regarding the Compact. Thank you.
Jeff

The WH just issued the below because the Biden story (based on interview with Peter Spiegel, WSJ, on way home from
Tblisi) gained momentum throughout the day
From Robert Gibbs:
""The President said in Moscow that the United States seeks a strong, peaceful and prosperous Russia - one that will be
an even more effective partner in meeting common challenges, including reducing nuclear arsenals, securing vulnerable
nuclear materials, contending with nuclear programs in North Korea and Iran, defeating violent extremism, and
advancing global security and economic growth.
Working together to advance security and prosperity for the American and Russian people is the focus of our effort to
reset relations. The President and Vice President believe Russia will work with us not out of weakness but out of
national interest.""

Subject: Re: Questions
o Is the 50k figure State and AID?
YES [U/S Kennedy & Ops]
o Re Sudan: how do you pronounce Abyei? What is % and dollar increase in
2010 budget for ops and aid?
Per the VoA pronunciation guide: ab-YAY (Ops). The FY09 base level for Sudan assistance programs is $327m vs $403m
in FY10- mostly related to infrastructure and election/referendum requirements. This does NOT include several hundred
million dollars of food aid and other humanitarian assistance that is also provided yearly (close to $400m on top of
numbers
below) a year. Also in addition is funding for UN peacekeeping missions- also nearly $200m a year. [D(L)]
o I don't understand the answer to the prostitution policy question. What's the simplest way to say it?
[Per D(L): Because of the politics of health care reform on the Hill, there is great sensitivity about addressing the
substance of these issues at this time.]
0: Under the previous Administration organizations receiving HIV\AIDs funds from the U.S. Government were required
to have a policy explicitly opposing prostitution and sex trafficking. Is that going to continue to be the policy of this
Administration?
A: This matter has been the subject of litigation - outside groups have sued both USAID and the HHS over the policy -
and we recently notified the Court that we needed additional time to review the policy. That review is underway; no
final decisions have been made.

You did a great job on Meet the Press. The only thing I would add is when they ask you about the relationship b/w you
and the White House you can say not only that you are the diplomat in chief and the implementer, but also the architect
of the strategies we need actually to achieve the objectives and the visions that the President lays out. I hope you saw
the piece by Sid Kaplan in Slate that says you and the President are closer than any administration in recent memory. I
hope you get at least a tiny piece of Sunday to yourself! AMS

Moscow preparations are in reasonable shape. Afghan lethal transit agreement is done, and will be signed on Monday.
There's also a broader statement on cooperation on counter-narcotics and reconstruction in Afghanistan. (Bakiyev has
now signed the Manas agreement, which is a further boost on Afghanistan.)
The Presidents will announce the bilateral
commission, and your trip to Russia in the fall to launch the process with Lavrov. All in all a good measured realistic
step in our effort to rebuild relations --
I'll be in Rome just for the first, ""foreign policy"" portion of the G8. We're working on a Leaders' statement that is likely
to look a lot like last week's G8 Foreign Ministers statement on most issues, with an update on North Korea, and
essentially the same, firm line on Iran.
I leave Rome on July 9 with an interagency delegation for stops in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Kyrgyzstan,
back in DC on July 14.
Hope you had a good Fourth, and all the best,
Bill

Whenever you do something big on TV we all hear from lots of folks saying you did great. But this time is noticeably
different. First, people across the spectrum - DC insiders, reporters, staff, ex-staff, friends of friends, WH folks, etc -
were blown away. Second, people were REALLY moved by the last segment, three people even told me they teared up.
I'm guessing and hoping you hear this directly from random folks in the coming days.
And I think because it's been a lousy couple of weeks for the Admin, with mixed messages and bad news, coupled with
many people seeing you for the first time for an extended period talking about the job and your relationship with the
President, and that combo was probably the most powerful reminder since your speech in Denver that you're in a class
all your own (including the President who became enmeshed in the Gates incident)
That you didn't wait for the envoy question was key, you turned it into a strength. What you said about the President
and how you said it, one can't help but think how much of a team player you are and how remarkably you've adapted to
the role.
You were definitely on your game. You either threw a perfect game - or at least a no hitter. So this couldn't have gone
better, achieved everything we needed to times 10, and comes on the heels of a great 10 days.
Will be interesting to see the storyline that emanates from this. Because there was no substantive news, it'll be a focus
on style - especially saving Biden.

Whenever you do something big on TV we all hear from lots of folks saying you did great. But this time is noticeably
different. First, people across the spectrum - DC insiders, reporters, staff, ex-staff, friends of friends, WH folks, etc -
were blown away. Second, people were REALLY moved by the last segment, three people even told me they teared up.
I'm guessing and hoping you hear this directly from random folks in the coming days.
And I think because it's been a lousy couple of weeks for the Admin, with mixed messages and bad news, coupled with
many people seeing you for the first time for an extended period talking about the job and your relationship with the
President, and that combo was probably the most powerful reminder since your speech in Denver that you're in a class
all your own (including the President who became enmeshed in the Gates incident)
That you didn't wait for the envoy question was key, you turned it into a strength. What you said about the President
and how you said it, one can't help but think how much of a team player you are and how remarkably you've adapted to
the role.
You were definitely on your game. You either threw a perfect game - or at least a no hitter. So this couldn't have gone
better, achieved everything we needed to times 10, and comes on the heels of a great 10 days.
Will be interesting to see the storyline that emanates from this. Because there was no substantive news, it'll be a focus
on style - especially saving Biden.

I've got to have Lona get invites out today - the list is 18 after speaking with the Secretary on theory we will have yield of
12 - 14.
Before I have Lona invite anyone, I want to phase invites so our highest priorities have chance to response first and need
to know how big is too big to work; I have targeted 12-14 outside guests - given an expectation of 6-8 government folks.

1. Shaun Woodward, UK Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, suggested a panel at CGI to be conducted by former
President Clinton of British and Irish prime ministers, and perhaps leaders in NI, under the theme of ""Implementing
Peace.""
2. Former President Clinton has conveyed to me his approval, contingent on approval of the State Department.
3. I have copied below (and attached) Woodward's letter to me.
4. Let me know to move this forward.
Dear Sid,
Following our conversations about the CGI, it would be good to try and explore further now with President Clinton and
State the idea for an event at the CGI for Northern Ireland.
As you know, and very much thanks to the help again of HRC, we hope to be able to move forward with the final phase
of the political process in the Autumn.
As the CGI coincides with the UN meeting and also the G20, we should explore the idea of whether we could bring
together and participation of both the British and Irish Prime Ministers under the auspices of the CGI. The theme could
be 'Implementing Peace'. The session would explore the steps for the peace and political process in NI and obviously a
session could have wider application into say the Middle East peace and political process.
To take this forward it would be helpful to explore this with President Clinton and State, and following their expression
of interest/approval, I would take this forward with the British and Irish Prime Ministers.
Let me know your thoughts.
Best
Shaun

Subject: Secretary Clinton Must Focus on Cause of Congo Conflict
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton should focus on the fuel which drives the violence in Congo, the conflict minerals
extracted from the eastern war zone and widely used by our consumer electronics industry. ""Clinton's visit to Goma
tomorrow provides the opportunity for the United States to deepen its overdue engagement in search of a solution for
the world's deadliest war,"" Enough Project co-founder John Prendergast said today.
""Tantalum helps cool cell phones and laptops. Tungsten enables the vibration function in a cell phone. Tin is a solder for
most circuit boards in nearly every electronic product. And gold is used to encase wiring. Until the trade in minerals
becomes legal and transparent, there will be no peace in Congo,"" Prendergast said.
Clinton earlier highlighted the role of conflict minerals in what she called ""the unspeakable violence against women and
girls in eastern Congo.""
""It is the worst example of man's inhumanity to women. And women are being used in conflicts. Now, what are the
conflicts about? Well, yes, there are tribal and other reasons why the conflicts are going on, but get below the surface.
It's because there are mines in eastern Congo that produce the minerals that go into our cell phones and our other
electronics. There is a lot of money being made by a lot of people, but it sure isn't helping the people of the DRC,""
Clinton said in an interview in Nairobi.
The majority of sexual violence cases reported in North Kivu since January have been attributed to government soldiers
according to the Congo Advocacy Coalition, a group of 88 humanitarian and human rights organizations, including
Enough Project. Early last month the Congolese Government announced a policy of ""zero tolerance"" for abuses
committed by army soldiers and said commanders who permit their troops to commit such crimes will be held
responsible but to date, only a handful of officers have been arrested.

At a recent Senate hearing on Sudan, Special Envoy Gration asked for ""more space on sanctions"" claiming that they were
hindering development in southern Sudan. Congress already took action in 2006 to create significant exceptions for the
south and other marginalized areas of Sudan for development purposes.
We should not roll back the sanctions. We need assurances from Secretary Clinton that the Obama Administration will

(SBU) Media report the Burmese court found Aung San Suu Kyi and two of her assistants guilty of violating security law.

Cheryl â€”
Well, I finally made it. Quite a start to be able to ride in with the President in AF1 and then roll into meetings with
Calderon and the leadership of the Mexican government. I will spend this week in Mexico. I will be back next week to
pack out, but will also follow up on a number of other issues while I am there.
I wanted to ask if you thought it might be possible to get a bit of time with the Secretary. There are two requests going
through the system. One is for a formal swearing in. I understand that she has one swearing in at 4:00 on Monday in
the Ben Franklin room, so one option would be if she could do the same for me in the Treaty Room at 4:30. I know this
is short notice â€” this has been one of those cases where planning has alluded us.
The second request is for a meeting with the Secretary. I would very much appreciate the chance to go over priorities
moving forward, as well as provide a few initial observations.

Preaching reform, Clinton wins African hearts
By DONNA BRYSON (AP) â€“1 hour ago
JOHANNESBURG â€” In Liberia, Hillary Clinton brought out the crowds despite torrential rain. In Congo, she came away
deeply shaken from a meeting with rape victims. Kenya's prime minister said Africa didn't need lectures from the West
about democracy, but Africa got one anyway.
At home, the U.S. secretary of state's visit may have been overshadowed by the aftermath of her husband's mission to
North Korea to bring home two imprisoned U.S. journalists. But on her seven-nation Africa tour, ending Friday with a
stopover in the West African island republic of Cape Verde, she made one splash after another.
Coupled with Barack Obama's visit last month, the two trips to Africa were the earliest into an administration by any
secretary of state or president, underlining Washington's pledges to pay more attention to the continent.
In the U.S., the headline-making moment of the trip was her testy response to a question about Bill Clinton. But in
Africa, it quickly became a footnote. What people wanted to hear was support for democracy, clean government and
ending its many civil wars.
Clinton's ambitious itinerary resembled those of China's foreign minister, who makes extensive annual tours of his
country's allies on the continent. But where China tends to sidestep the issues of corruption democracy, Clinton
confronted them head-on.
Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga, speaking hours before Clinton arrived, said Africa did not need to be lectured about
democracy. After they met, she did just that. ""The absence of strong and effective democratic institutions has permitted
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759145 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759145 Date: 06/30/2015
ongoing corruption, impunity, politically motivated violence and a lack of respect for a rule of law,"" Clinton said. ""These
conditions ... are continuing to hold Kenya back.""
Odinga switched to a more conciliatory tone, saying African countries could learn from Clinton's example when she
conceded defeat to Obama during the U.S. presidential primaries.
""That is a lesson Africa needs to learn seriously,"" he said. ""In Africa, in many countries, elections are never won, they are
only rigged. The losers never accept that they lost. If we do this, we will be able to develop democracy truly in the
African continent.""
In Angola, she told Foreign Minister Assuncao Afonso dos Anjos that his country needed to write a new constitution,
prosecute human rights crimes and hold a proper presidential election.
""So, Mr. Minister, we have our work cut out for us,"" she said.
And in Nigeria, Africa's biggest oil producer, she said ""the disconnect between Nigeria's wealth and its poverty is a
failure of governance at the federal, state and local level.""
To Africa's reformers, often an embattled minority, these were heartening words.
Emma Ezeazu, who campaigns for free and fair elections in his native Nigeria, said Clinton's visit showed that U.S.
officials ""are becoming more pro-active in their relationship with Nigeria, in particular on the subject of governance and
democracy. They are paying more attention.""
Tiseke Kasambala, a Johannesburg-based researcher for Human Rights Watch, commended her grasp of human rights
abuses in Africa â€” not just the headline-makers, like Zimbabwe and Congo, but the lesser publicized offenders such as
Angola.
In Goma, a Congo town in a region ravaged by gang rapes amid continuing fighting between army and rebels, Clinton
announced $17 million in American aid to help the victims.
She toured a squalid camp of 18,000 refugees and heard one of them tell her, ""We really want to return home, that's
why we are asking America to help stop the fighting.""
""That's why I'm here,"" Clinton replied. ""I want you to be able to go home.""
In Cape Town, South Africa, big, joyous crowds turned out for her at a housing project. In Liberia, founded in 1847 by
freed American slaves, rain-drenched crowds waved U.S. and Liberian flags at Clinton's motorcade.
The crowds in Nigeria and Angola were fewer, but community and religious leaders seemed excited just to be with
Clinton and be heard by her.
Nancy Kachingwe, a Malawian with the development group ActionAid, applauded Clinton's ""very strong emphasis
around women's rights.""
Some of former President George W. Bush's Africa initiatives, particularly on AIDS, have been widely praised in Africa.
But there were also sharp differences over world trade, global warming, and over the Bush administration's anti-
terrorism strategy.
Washington wants to buy Africa's oil and gain access to its markets, and fears instability in places like Somalia could fuel
anti-U.S. terrorism. Clinton won points by stressing that as the U.S. pursues its interests, it sees the virtue of ""working
with and listening to our friends and allies, and creating not a multipolar world, but a multi-partner world.""

Kachingwe said what matters now is the follow-up.
""There will be a positive impact"" from Clinton's trip, she said. ""But somewhere along the way, we do need to see ...
what's going to come to keep the momentum going.""

Clinton Ends Africa Tour, Vowing to Stay Involved By JEFFREY GETTLEMAN The New York Times
Published: August 15, 2009
SANTA MARIA, Cape Verde - After a grueling seven-nation, 11-day trip, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton
wrapped up her Africa tour on Friday by reaffirming her promise to renovate American relations with the continent.
""I leave Africa after this remarkable trip even more committed,"" Mrs. Clinton said before leaving Cape Verde.
""I have seen the joy and energy Africans have, evidenced not just by the boogieing, but by the hard work and
perseverance,"" she said, referring to a recent comment from her husband, former President Bill Clinton, that she knew
how to ""boogie"" with African dancers.
""And we've seen the worst humanity can do to itself,"" she added, presumably referring to Congo, where Mrs. Clinton
met victims of a brutal civil war that just does not seem to end.
Mrs. Clinton seemed satisfied that she had accomplished her mission: strengthening American relations with crucial
allies on the continent, like Nigeria and South Africa, and sending a message of ""tough love,"" as she called it, to nations
like Kenya and Congo.
Over all, she said, the United States wants to work more closely with African nations as a partner, not simply as a patron
or dispenser of aid. In exchange, she said, African leaders must deliver democracy and good government.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759228 Date: 06/30/2015
Mrs. Clinton vowed to stay on top of Africa, even after she gets back to Washington, closely monitoring the issues she
addressed on her tour. She also pointed to Cape Verde, a set of palm-studded islands best known for their beaches and
enormous tourist hotels, as an example of what good leadership can do.
""This is possible,"" she said. ""You create not just economic growth but a sense of human dignity and possibility.""
Kenya. South Africa. Angola. Congo. Nigeria. Liberia. And finally Cape Verde. Mrs. Clinton saw with her own eyes some of
Africa's most promising countries - and some of its most troubled ones. In Kenya, she pushed for the government to
prosecute perpetrators of the postelection violence last year. In South Africa, the big issue was Zimbabwe and how the
South African government should do more to help ease the crisis there.
In Angola, the theme was good governing practices and oil, a strategic concern of the United States given the many
inroads China has made there and elsewhere in Africa in its hunger for natural resources. In Congo, Mrs. Clinton was
passionate about the need to end the nation's rape epidemic.
""The secretary's visit to the heart of the world's deadliest war zone in eastern Congo was a potential game-changer for
that conflict,"" said John Prendergast, a founder of the Washington-based Enough project. ""Her commitment to
addressing root causes such as the conflict minerals that power our electronics industry was a refreshing contrast to the
usual disaster sympathy tourism of visiting dignitaries.""
""Now,"" he added, ""comes the hard part: making good on the promises and living up to the high expectations
engendered by her visit.""
In Nigeria, Mrs. Clinton pressed for electoral changes. In Liberia, she praised the country's president, Ellen Johnson
Sirleaf, the only woman in Africa to be elected head of state.
The Liberian visit had a special warmth, almost like a meeting of long-lost cousins. Liberia was founded in the 19th
century by freed American slaves, and the country's flag, the people's names and even the police uniforms with plastic-
brimmed hats were all reminiscent of the American versions. Mrs. Clinton received possibly her most exuberant
welcome there, and a Liberian man with a long wooden horn followed her around most of the visit, blowing out loud
funny noises whenever she said something striking.
""I love that - the horn - I want to take that guy with me wherever I go,"" she said.
In Cape Verde, Mrs. Clinton seemed to have few bones to pick. For once, she said, she had a cheat sheet on a country
that included a list of far more positives than negatives. The country has fewer than 500,000 people and has escaped the
turmoil that has engulfed so much of Africa. The all-inclusive, poolside buffet resorts here feel like something found in
Canci.ln or the Bahamas.
Mrs. Clinton called Cape Verde ""a model of democracy and economic progress in Africa.""
On Friday, just as she had at every stop, she started her speech by saying, ""I bring you greetings from President Obama.""
She called him a ""son of Africa"" and said that under the Obama administration, the United States was determined to
help Africa reach its promise.

Jake -- Peter Harrell and I have been concerned all last week that we are really losing the initiative on Honduras and that
some more forceful intervention is needed. I think this is a real opportunity for S to get her first real diplomatic win on
resolving a crisis. She looked great at the outset of this crisis, but now American policy seems to be drifting. It's also a
chance to turn her and POTUS's recent words on democracy into action. Pse get the attached 1 page memo to her
today; I have been working w/ WHA but they take forever and Tom is obviously in a delicate position. I'm also pasting it
in below, in addition to a cable from our ambassador that she has probably seen making some of the same points. We
really need to move here to avoid further damage; on the upside we have the possibility of a real win. I'll make the

high level people from both the business and the NGO community say that even our friends are beginning to think we
are not really committed to the norm of constitutional democracy we have worked so hard to build over the last 20
year. The current stalemate favors the status quo; the de facto regime has every incentive to run out the clock as long as
they think we will have to accept any post-election government You played an important leadership role at the outset of
the crisis; I urge you to think about taking bold action now to breathe new life into the process and signal that regardless

options, but experience has taught me that this could take several days. So I wanted to give you a heads up this
weekend.
We need to strengthen both the carrots and the sticks in this process. Re the de factos, we should find that coup
was a ""military coup"" under U.S. law and revoke the visas of more de facto regime members. We should also go after
the visas of a few prominent de facto supporters in Honduras's business community, signaling that we'll widen this net
if negotiations fail. We should also make noises about prohibiting U.S. companies from.doing business with companies
controlled the de factos, though we have to be careful about the impact on Honduran institutions.
CABLE FROM AMB. Llorens, SENT YESTERDAY MORNING.
AIL: I received a call from Arias late last night. He seemed to be recovering well from the flu but was at his home
resting. I briefed him on how I saw the situation in Honduras. I stressed the importance of a successful visit by the OAS
FMs. I agreed M's recent public comments again suggesting that Insulza was not welcomed were unhelpful. I noted that
somewhat better was the statement made by the Corrales delegation yesterday at a press conference in Toncontin
Airport upon returning from DC reaffirming that Insulza was expected to be with the delegation. I told Arias the
importance of arranging a substantive schedule for the FMs w regime, civil society, business, and religious leaders as
well as pro-Zelaya social sector supporters. I also stressed the importance of giving these folks a fair hearing but also
that it was critical that the FMs explain the international community's expectations and strong hope that both sides
return quickly to San Jose and reach and sign a final agreement.
Arias concurred that that was also his expectation. He expressed concern that the regime may be seeking to stall and
delay. He said the regime delegation did not seemed fully committed to reaching a deal and seemed focused on
tinkering with the political amnesty question. Arias believes that the core regime supporters in the business community
were still strongly resisting an agreement. He suggested that the US needed to increase the pressure on these folks and
consider taking away their visas and possibly freeze their bank accounts. I said I would pass on his suggestion. I said we
were reaching out to people in Honduras and urging the importance of a succesful FMs meeting as a prelude to a final
agreement. I said I would also speak to Corrales and get him focused on having the regime prepared for the FMs with
creative and concrete ways of bolstering the enforcement aspects of a final deal. Arias thanked our support and we
agreed to speak again over the weekend. Hugo

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
September 11, 2009 Contact: Senator Levin's Office
Phone: 202.224.6221
Senate Floor Speech - Surge the Afghan Army
Remarks as prepared for delivery
Today we mark a solemn anniversary. Eight years ago this morning, our nation was attacked by terrorist extremists
motivated by hatred and bent on destruction. It is always appropriate to remember the shock of that day, the innocent
lives lost, and the efforts our nation has made since that day to ensure that Afghanistan, the nation that hosted those
terrorists, cannot again become a safe haven for terrorists seeking to attack us. But today is an especially appropriate
occasion to take stock of those efforts, and consider how best to continue them.
I recently returned from a trip to Afghanistan, where I was joined by my colleagues Senators Jack Reed and Ted
Kaufman. The situation in Afghanistan is serious. Security has deteriorated. But if we take the right steps, we can ensure
that Afghanistan does not revert to a Taliban-friendly government that could once again provide a safe haven for al
Qaeda to terrorize us and the world.
The Obama administration's new strategy, focusing on securing the Afghan population's safety and partnering with the
Afghan security forces in that effort, is an important start at reversing the situation in Afghanistan. The change in
strategy has led our forces, in the words of General McChrystal's Counterinsurgency Guidance, to ""live, eat and train
together [with the Afghan security forces], plan and operate together, depend on one another, and hold each other
accountable....and treat them as equal partners in success."" The Guidance goes on to say that the success of the Afghan
security forces ""is our goal.""

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759468 Date: 06/30/2015
To achieve that goal we should increase and accelerate our efforts to support the Afghan security forces in their efforts
to become self-sufficient in delivering security to their nation â€” before we consider whether to increase U.S. combat
forces above the levels already planned for the next few months. These steps include increasing the size of the Afghan
Army and police much faster than presently planned; providing more trainers for the Afghan Army and police than
presently planned; providing them more equipment than presently planned; and working to separate local Taliban
fighters from their leaders and attract them to the side of the government as we did in Iraq.
While the security situation in Afghanistan has worsened, we still have important advantages there. The Afghan people
hate the Taliban. Public opinion polls show support for the Taliban at about 5%. In addition, the Afghan army is highly
motivated and its troops are proven fighters.
Despite those advantages, we face significant challenges. General McChrystal believes, and I agree, that we need to
regain the initiative and create a momentum towards success. General McChrystal worries, and rightly so, about the
perception that we have lost that initiative, and the impact of that perception on the Afghan people, their government,
al Qaeda and the Taliban. By contrast, if we can dispel that perception, we have a chance to convince local and lower-
level Taliban fighters to lay down their arms and rejoin Afghan society.
I believe the most effective way to retake the initiative in Afghanistan is with a series of steps to ensure that
Afghanistan's army and police have the manpower, equipment and support to secure their own nation.
First, we should increase troop levels for the Afghan army and police faster than currently planned. There are
approximately 90,000 troops in the Afghan army now, and that number is scheduled to go up to 134,000 by October of
2010. The Afghan police are scheduled to reach a level of 82,000 by the same time. For a long time, many of us have
urged the establishment of a goal of 240,000 Afghan troops and 160,000 Afghan police by 2013. The Afghan Minister of
Defense has strongly supported those numbers. It now appears that our government and the Afghan government are
prepared to accept those goals. But the need for additional Afghan forces is urgent. I believe it both possible and
essential to advance those goals by a year, to 2012.
Our own military in Afghariistan has repeatedly pointed to a need for more Afghan forces. In one sector of Helmand
province we visited last week, our Marines outnumbered Afghan soldiers by 5 to one. A Marine Company commander in
Helmand province told the New York Times in July that a lack of Afghan troops ""is absolutely our Achilles heel.""
What do we need to do to increase the size of the Afghan army and police? According to Afghan Defense Minister
Wardak, there is no lack of Afghan manpower; we've been assured it is available.
But we will need significantly more trainers. We asked General Formica, who is in charge of the American effort to train
Afghan security forces, whether such an increase is possible. He indicated he would make an assessment of what would
be necessary in order to meet the earlier timetable. In the meantime, we should also press our NATO allies with much
greater forcefulness to provide more trainers. If our NATO allies are not going to come through with the combat forces
they have pledged, at least they could provide additional trainers.
Larger Afghan security forces will also require more mid-level Afghan officers. In addition to supporting efforts to
graduate more Afghan officers from army academies, we should consider the recommendation of Defense Minister
Wardak that previous mid-level officers who fought the war against the Soviets return to service on an interim basis.
Minister Wardak emphasized that those men are well qualified and well motivated, and while they may not be trained in
the most current tactics, they nonetheless could temporarily meet the need of the enlarged army while the new group
of officers is trained. A larger Afghan force will need supporting infrastructure, such a barracks. While the available
infrastructure may not be the most modern, it is adequate and exists in sufficient amounts.
Larger Afghan security forces will require additional equipment. There must be a major effort to transfer a significant
amount of the equipment that is coming out of Iraq to the Afghan army and police. Such a significant commitment to
equip the Afghan security forces would also help demonstrate U.S. determination to take the initiative and create
momentum in the right direction. There is an enormous amount of equipment coming out of Iraq; our military is calling

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759468 Date: 06/30/2015
it one of the greatest transfers of military goods in the world's history. A significant part of it could be transferred to the
Afghan forces, increasing their capability without weakening our own readiness. And yet there does not seem to be that
kind of a crash effort in place to do that. We need to obtain on an urgent basis a list of the basic equipment needs of the
Afghan forces and a list of how those needs could be met in a major program to transfer equipment leaving Iraq.
Rapidly expanding Afghanistan's military and police forces would address one of the major problems and risks we now
face there. General McChrystal told us he worries that waiting until 2013 for a larger Afghan force creates a gap in
capabilities that brings significant risk of failure. But by accelerating the training and equipping of Afghan forces by a
year, we address his concern. Depending on additional capability from Afghan, rather than U.S., forces, also addresses a
major problem of public perception in Afghanistan. The larger our own military footprint there, the more our enemies
can seek to drive a wedge between us and the Afghan population, spreading the falsehood that we seek to dominate a
Muslim nation.
Finally, we should make a concerted effort to separate the local Taliban from their leaders. In Iraq, large numbers of
young Iraqis who had been attacking us switched over to our side and became.the ""Sons of Iraq."" They were drawn in
part by the promise of jobs and amnesty for past attacks, and in part by the recognition that the status quo was creating
horrific violence in their own communities. In their own interests and the interests of their nation, they switched sides
and became a positive force.
That same prospect exists in Afghanistan. Afghan leaders and our military say that local Taliban fighters are motivated
largely by the need for a job or loyalty to the local leader who pays them and not by ideology or religious zeal. They
believe an effort to attract these fighters to the government's side could succeed, if they are offered security for
themselves and their families, and if there is no penalty for previous activity against us.
General McChrystal himself has emphasized the potential of such re-integration to accomplish the same result as was
achieved in Iraq. Here is what General McChrystal said on July 28th:
""Most of the fighters we see in Afghanistan are Afghans, some with foreign cadre with them. But most we don't see are
deeply ideological or even politically motivated; most are operating for pay; some are under a commander's charismatic
leadership; some are frustrated with local leaders. So I believe there is significant potential to go after what I would call
mid- and low-level Taliban fighters and leaders and offer them re-integration into Afghanistan under the constitution.""
But this ""game changing"" possibility was apparently not factored into General McChrystal's assessment. There is no plan
yet to put in place a Sons of Iraq approach in Afghanistan. It is urgent that we lay out the steps that need to be taken to
involve local and national Afghan leaders in that effort. They alone can accomplish this crucial job, but first we and our
Afghan allies must draft such a plan on an urgent basis. And the potential positive impact of such a plan should be taken
into account as we consider the need for any additional U.S. military resources.
Afghanistan's people are grateful for our aid, but also eager to assume responsibility for their future. In a tiny village in
Helmand Province, we were invited to meet with the village elders at their council meeting, their shura. One hundred or
so men sat on the floor and chatted with us about their future and their country's future. When asked how long the
United States should stay, one elder said: ""Until the moment that you make our security forces self-sufficient. Then you
will be welcome to visit us, not as soldiers but as guests.""
Helping Afghanistan achieve self-sufficiency in their security is everybody's goal. On that there is little difference of
opinion, in Afghanistan's village councils or in the corridors of this Capitol.
Can we help Afghanistan reach self-sufficiency in security fast enough? Can we get there in a way that regains the
initiative and creates the momentum we need? Can we encourage those lower level Taliban to abandon an insurgency
headed by terrorists whose fanaticism they don't share?
I believe we can, by supporting a far more rapid growth in the Afghan Army and police; by providing more trainers more
quickly; by a rapid infusion to Afghan units of equipment no longer needed in Iraq; and by rapidly adopting a plan for the
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759468 Date: 06/30/2015

re-integration of lower level Taliban fighters into Afghan society. In other words, we need a surge of Afghan security
forces.
Our support of their surge will show our commitment to the success of a mission that is clearly in our national security
interest, without creating a bigger U.S. military footprint that provides propaganda fodder for the Taliban.
I believe that taking those steps on an urgent basis, While completing the previously planned and announced increase in
U.S. combat forces, provides the best chance of success for our mission: preventing Afghanistan from again being run by
a Taliban government which harbors and supports Al-Qaeda, whose goal is to inflict additional catastrophic attacks on
the United States and the world. And we should implement these steps before considering an increase in U.S. ground
combat forces beyond what is already planned by the end of this year.

Odds On the Big A <http://leftatthegate.blogspot.com/2009/09/odds-on-big.html>
Even as Governor Paterson reportedly has his recommendation on the Aqueduct racino in hand (this reader says
that he actually has two to consider <http://leftatthegate.blogspot.com/2009/09/sunday-morning-notes-and-
nuts.html#comment-1156672372250588546> ), at least one of the bidders is still taking its case to the local community
around the track. The Queens Chronicle reported last week
<http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=20368289&BRD=2731&PAG=461&dept_id=574908&rfi=6> that SL
Green/Hard Rock made a presentation on Thursday.
""Hard Rock is the right balance,"" [Pres/CEO Marc] Holliday said. ""Its recognized brand and quality entertainment
will attract younger and older players across the stratum. People flying in from JFK will say, 'I hear there's a Hard Rock, I
want to see it.""
One of this group's big pitches is that they'll be the first to generate a revenue stream (""shovel-ready, in the
ground, the day after the award."")
And thanks to the reader who alerted us to this article in Crain's
<http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20090913/FREE/309139964> which, more importantly than comprising yet
another virtual press release for Steve Wynn, contains, towards the bottom, a handy pocket guide to the six bidders, the
financial portion of their bids (or at least what is known about them), and the ups and downs of their proposals.
This is a tough call; handicapping without the Form as I said before. I can't say I have a favorite; neither a
particular personal preference, nor a clue as to the most likely winner. But I'll give it a shot and take the Crain's piece
one step further by coming up with a morning line.
<http://1.bp.blogspot.com/yiJ1ri4LCfk/Sq2_nTNU jI/AAAAAAAABHM/UucITWnkilM/s1600-
h/dont_bother.jpg> Aqueduct Entertainment Group <http://www.aqueductentertainment.comk (3-1): Competitive bid
of $251 million (contingent on 7,650 machines; $301 million with 10,000), a plethora of local connections on the real
estate/construction side, and approval by local unions could compensate for the lack of brand name recognition of
gaming partner The Navegante Group. Presence of Senator Malcolm Smith's longtime confidante Rev. Floyd Flake
doesn't hurt either.
SL Green/Hard Rock (4-1) - Boosted its bid to $275 million, and has the Hard Rock brand name as mentioned
above. Manhattan-based realtor SL Green has been endorsed by several local unions
<http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3601/is_43_54/ai_n27894917/> . But, as mentioned by Crain's, they were
passed over in favor of Delaware North the first time around.
Aqueduct Gaming (6-1), Buffalo-based Delaware North's group, has rallied late with a stepped-up publicity effort
and a major community initiative <http://leftatthegate.blogspot.com/2009/08/back-in-game.html> after appearing
indifferent early on (though it's original $100 million upfront offer remains intact with an additional $200 million to
follow). The addition of Harrah's <http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/Aqueduct-Gaming-L1c-1034906.html>
adds an experienced operator and an interesting cross-marketing twist which is probably not allowed under the now-
disappeared MOU. And, like the two bidders above, Aqueduct Gaming has been reported to have reached
accommodations with the unions. So I listed them as the third choice on these merits. However, a part of me wants to
list them as the rank outsider - I'd be pretty damn shocked if the state goes back to the company which dropped out
after failing to raise the money last time. And, as I've mentioned several times, given the reports of an investigation
<http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2009/05/01/2009-05-
01_attorney_general_andrew_cuomo_subpoenas_contracts_won_by_clients_offirm_tied_to.html> by Attorney
General Andrew Cuomo into lobbyist Patricia Lynch's dealings with the Assembly Speaker, I don't know if her
involvement here is going to help or hurt.
Steve Wynn (8-1) has offered $300 million, but he was the only bidder of the six contenders to receive a bad
grade from the hotel unions <http://www.timesunion.com/AspStories/story.asp?storylD=838256&category=STATE> as
reported by Jim Odato in the Times Union last week. Whatsmore, the scale of his building proposal
<http://www.queenstribune.com/news/1250798405.html> is laughably ridiculous, and it wouldn't be ready until 2011.
He'd be the favorite if the decision is based on the number of newspaper and online articles
<http://leftatthegate.blogspot.com/2009/08/all-wynn-all-of-time.html> each bidder has been featured in. But, quite
simply, he sometimes comes off as a nut
<http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/cindy_adams/wynn_hopes_to_win_racefor_race_hzqJ384wLxUSxFKsUWiSyM> .
Penn National (12-1) might be worth a ducat at long odds. No local connection here makes them a dark horse.
But a $250 million bid (as reported elsewhere <http://blog.timesunion.com/capitol/archives/17717/penn-national-
lobbies-up/> though not in the Crain's piece) puts them in the ballgame, and the company is an experienced gaming
operator with a solid balance sheet
<http://www.businessweek.com/investor/content/aug2009/pi20090814_742719.htm> which would probably do as
competent a job as anyone else.
R. Donahue Peebles/MGM Mirage (20-1) didn't increase its $150 million bid, and doesn't have a lobbyist; good
luck with that. Whatsmore, no local flavor and MGM Mirage has had some well-publicized financial woes (though things
have been looking up of late <http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125212120561188377.html> ). Would be a major
surprise.

SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED
Somalia
Cheryl noted that she needed to hear further from the Secretary on the proposed changes to the OFAC letter with
respect to humanitarian assistance to Somalia and the potential for diversion. She indicated she would let Eric Schwartz
know where things stand.

Jack stressed his continued concern over funding for the transfer of police training responsibilities from Defense to
State, noting that it remains ""highly ambiguous."" (The estimated cost is an initial $500 million, with an additional $700
million a year in expenses.) Defense is insisting it does not have money to transfer to State for this purpose, and the
idea of a Supplemental is problematic, not the least because the timing would not coincide with the transfer of
responsibilities. Jack is concerned that we will look like we are holding up the transfer.
Chinese Tires
Jim reported that there had been another meeting on Chinese tire imports yesterday where there was interagency
agreement on the ""first best option,"" but disagreement over other options. The Chinese are in town for negotiations
and there will be another meeting tomorrow after the first round.
Baghdad Management Issues
Eric Boswell noted that the Department would extend
Eric also noted that the roof of the USAID building in Baghdad had collapsed.
Congressional Issues
Rich said that he met with Senator DeMint yesterday to discuss the holds on Valenzuela and Shannon. Rich thinks
DeMint is prepared to let Valenzuela go forward, but would like to speak to Jim Steinberg regarding Honduras. He will
insist on a debate and roll call vote for Tom Shannon. DeMint apparently warned, however, that any ""substantive
change"" in our current policy vis-Ã -vis Honduras would jeopardize both nominations.
Codel Levin will be heading to Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iraq, but will not overlap with Jack Lew's stay in those
places.

Legal Issues
Harold said that one fallout from the renewed focus on Libya is that some former claimants are coming back
seeking new relief.
Hurricane Jimena
I noted that Hurricane Jimena is expected to make landfall in Baja early tomorrow morning as a powerful Category
4 or 5 Hurricane. Embassy Mexico City and Consulate General Tijuana have issued warden messages and Consular
Affairs has put out a travel alert advising citizens to avoid the areas likely to be hit. Many hotels in the path of the storm
have been largely evacuated, but there are still many Americans who could be affected. The Ops Center is in close touch
with our missions in Mexico to monitor conditions.
Public Affairs
RI anticipates questions about Iran's alleged willingness to restart talks and whether the Secretary will meet with
Zelaya.
Deputies Meeting Highlights
Sri Lanka
The War Crimes Office said that the report to the Hill on alleged war crimes in Sri Lanka is due by September 21.
They have prepared a 60-page draft which is now circulating for clearance. The report covers the period up to May, but
Jack encouraged the Office to consider including later material if it would be helpful.
Pakistani Internally Displaced Persons
Eric Schwartz said that the Op-ed in today's post by Morton Abramowitz criticizing the U.S. and Pakistan for
allegedly forcing the return of IDPs into Swat and other areas is simply not true. Eric said he would call Mort to discuss
this.

Export Controls
Andrew Shapiro noted that the interagency process aimed at ""reforming"" export controls gets underway today.
The goal is to have something to present to Deputies in six weeks.
Brazilian Oil Development
David Goldwyn said that Brazil's proposed regulations for developing its vast offshore petroleum reserves were
disappointing. Brazil seems to have opted for a nationalist model that will substantially delay bringing on line the most
promising non-OPEC source of oil in years.
H1N1
OES reported that the Administration will release its report on H1N1 in the Southern Hemisphere today. The
analysis of the virus in several developed countries in the region suggests that it has not mutated and that the vaccine
being developed should be effective. It is still not clear, however, whether one or two doses will be required.

Somalia
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759513 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759513 Date: 06/30/2015
Cheryl noted that she needed to hear further from the Secretary on the proposed changes to the OFAC letter with
respect to humanitarian assistance to Somalia and the potential for diversion. She indicated she would let Eric Schwartz
know where things stand.
Afghanistan
No one has yet seen the McChrystal Report.
Iraq
Jack stressed his continued concern over funding for the transfer of police training responsibilities from Defense to
State, noting that it remains ""highly ambiguous."" (The estimated cost is an initial $500 million, with an additional $700
million a year in expenses.) Defense is insisting it does not have money to transfer to State for this purpose, and the
idea of a Supplemental is problematic, not the least because the timing would not coincide with the transfer of
responsibilities. Jack is concerned that we will look like we are holding up the transfer.
Chinese Tires
Jim reported that there had been another meeting on Chinese tire imports yesterday where there was interagency
agreement on the ""first best option,"" but disagreement over other options. The Chinese are in town for negotiations
and there will be another meeting tomorrow after the first round.
Baghdad Management Issues
Eric Boswell noted that the Department would extend
Eric also noted that the roof of the USAID building in Baghdad had collapsed.

Congressional Issues
Rich said that he met with Senator DeMint yesterday to discuss the holds on Valenzuela and Shannon. Rich thinks
DeMint is prepared to let Valenzuela go forward, but would like to speak to Jim Steinberg regarding Honduras. He will
insist on a debate and roll call vote for Tom Shannon. DeMint apparently warned, however, that any ""substantive
change"" in our current policy vis-Ã -vis Honduras would jeopardize both nominations.
Codel Levin will be heading to Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iraq, but will not overlap with Jack Lew's stay in those
places.
Legal Issues
Harold said that one fallout from the renewed focus on Libya is that some former claimants are coming back
seeking new relief.
Hurricane Jimena
I noted that Hurricane Jimena is expected to make landfall in Baja early tomorrow morning as a powerful Category
4 or 5 Hurricane. Embassy Mexico City and Consulate General Tijuana have issued warden messages and Consular
Affairs has put out a travel alert advising citizens to avoid the areas likely to be hit. Many hotels in the path of the storm
have been largely evacuated, but there are still many Americans who could be affected. The Ops Center is in close touch
with our missions in Mexico to monitor conditions.
Public Affairs
â€¢ PJ anticipates questions about Iran's alleged willingness to restart talks and whether the Secretary will meet with
Zelaya.
Deputies Meeting Highlights
Sri Lanka
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759513 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759513 Date: 06/30/2015
â€¢ The War Crimes Office said that the report to the Hill on alleged war crimes in Sri Lanka is due by September 21.
They have prepared a 60-page draft which is now circulating for clearance. The report covers the period up to May, but
Jack encouraged the Office to consider including later material if it would be helpful.
Pakistani Internally Displaced Persons
â€¢ Eric Schwartz said that the Op-ed in today's post by Morton Abramowitz criticizing the U.S. and Pakistan for
allegedly forcing the return of IDPs into Swat and other areas is simply not true. Eric said he would call Mort to discuss
this.
Export Controls
Andrew Shapiro noted that the interagency process aimed at ""reforming"" export controls gets underway today.
The goal is to have something to present to Deputies in six weeks.
Brazilian Oil Development
David Goldwyn said that Brazil's proposed regulations for developing its vast offshore petroleum reserves were
disappointing. Brazil seems to have opted for a nationalist model that will substantially delay bringing on line the most
promising non-OPEC source of oil in years.
H1N1
OES reported that the Administration will release its report on H1N1 in the Southern Hemisphere today. The
analysis of the virus in several developed countries in the region suggests that it has not mutated and that the vaccine
being developed should be effective. It is still not clear, however, whether one or two doses will be required.

Dear Melanne,
We've been in contact with Salam Alshehri, the project coordinator of the newly launched Entelak school program
Glamour helped create for young girls through Sana'a's Girls World Communication Center. She reports that they are in
contact with Nujood who is in fact in third grade at a private school. While Nujood isn't in the demographic for the
Entelak Project since she's still young enough for public (free) education, she is the role model for the targeted girls.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759525 Date: 06/30/2015
And since Nujood is the spirit of the Project, Salam and her colleagues are thinking of ways to include her in the activities
and trainings as much as possible.
We've also spoken to Delphine Minoui, the French reporter who first covered Nujood's case and has since co-written
Nujood's autobiography. Delphine has taken on the funding of Nujood's private schooling and confirms that Nujood is in
fact still attending school. CNN got it wrong apparently,
Let me know if you'd like to brainstorm about other ways to help support Nujood.
All best,

Counseling That Helps the Dying Live
By Devin Talbott and Strobe Talbott
Saturday, August 29, 2009
Many opponents of health-care reform have concentrated their fire on a provision in House legislation that would
provide for government reimbursement to doctors who offer end-of-life counseling. How our society deals with those
confronting death is understandably controversial. Unfortunately, the debate has degenerated into a cacophony of
demagoguery and distortion, including invocations of Hitler and fear-mongering about ""death panels."" As a result of
these attacks, a number of senators who are key to determining what bill will emerge from Congress have abandoned
support for end-of-life counseling.
Our family's experience this year provided a vivid perspective on the value of that service and the misguidedness of the
campaign against it. Brooke Shearer <http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-
dyn/content/article/2009/05/19/AR2009051903475.html> -- wife, mother and grandmother -- had been fighting cancer
for more than a year. She had undergone major surgery, numerous scans and biopsies, and two debilitating courses of
chemotherapy. Her doctors were among the best in their fields. Their expertise did not, however, extend to the fine
points of, and latest advances in, pain management.
Brooke was determined to maintain the highest possible quality of her own life and that of her family for whatever time
we had together. With that goal in mind, she sought advice and treatment from palliative-care specialists at Washington
Home and Community Hospices. Their ingenuity and skill in adjusting her medications significantly alleviated her
discomfort in her final months. Working closely with her primary physicians, the hospice staff helped Brooke anticipate
the likely course of her disease in a way that allowed her to make decisions and exercise a degree of control over both
her own condition and our family's adjustment to it.
When her oncologist concluded that chemotherapy was not working, Brooke put herself fully into the hands of
Washington Home as an outpatient. Regular house calls by hospice doctors, nurses and social workers enabled her to
stay active on professional projects, spend time with friends and family, and end her life at home, which was a
considerable comfort to her and to us.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759543 Date: 06/30/2015
These, not issues of cost, were the principal considerations for our family. However, controlling the cost of health care --
especially in the last year of life -- is an important part of the current national debate. Therefore it is worth noting that
Brooke's treatment in the last stages of her illness was far less expensive than it had been in the previous year.
It has often been said that dying can be a full-time job. That was emphatically not the case with Brooke. Until her final
days, she concentrated on living -- a choice that end-of-life counseling helped make possible. Hospice care more than
meets the standard of the Hippocratic oath: It not only does no harm -- it does good; it is not about hastening death but
enhancing life. If counseling about hospice services and palliative care is a beneficiary of health care reform, many
Americans will be as well.

Subject: Possible Rieser Call on Foreign Ops Bill
Cheryl:
We have just learned that Tim Rieser may call you soon to request that the Secretary call Senator Reid to urge him take
up the FY10 State/Foreign Ops Appropriations Bill at the earliest opportunity in Septemberâ€” to avoid the negative
impact of a continuing resolution on State operations and programs.
As you know, if Senator Reid was able/willing to schedule time on the Senate floor there still remains a significant
obstacle. While the FY10 Bill had broad bipartisan support prior to markup, it now includes a controversial Lautenberg
amendment that would reverse the Mexico City policy statutorily. With Lautenberg's amendment in the Bill, procedural
hurdles are almost certain to lengthen and slow down floor action.
It is possible that an agreement could be reached to bring up the Bill and structure votes so that the Republicans could
offer amendments including one to strike Lautenberg's language.
Should you agree to ask the Secretary to make such a call I would imagine she would want to get views from Jack Lew,
Pat Kennedy, Rich Greene, and Rich Verma, first.
Here are some points to consider for such a possible call:
Timely enactment of the FY 10 State/Foreign Ops appropriation is critical to national security.
â€¢ Operating under a Continuing Resolution for any extended period of time will negatively impact both State
operations and foreign assistance programs.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759552 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759552 Date: 06/30/2015
â€¢ For example, the funds available to support State operations in Iraq are estimated to last only through the first
quarter of FY 2010. In addition our urgent hiring plans will be stifled, pay equity authorities will lapse, and we will be
without the necessary resources to implement our agenda on food security, climate change, and global health.
I urge you to take up the FY 10 State/Foreign Ops bill as early as possible in September.
Background
Mexico City Policy: The inclusion during markup of the Lautenberg amendment in the Senate bill codifies a ban on future
adoption of the Mexico City Policy. This controversial issue will slow down consideration of the Bill, as the Minority will
use parliamentary maneuvers to block timely debate and final passage.

I called her because we had a tie for the FSO's and I wanted to see if she'd provide a second monetary award so we
wouldn't have to divide the $5k. She agreed and then told me
State will fly in the awardees and the Secry usually gives out the award. Swanee is hoping that she'll be able to come and

Jake and Cheryl,
Allison Stanger is a professor at Middlebury who has a book coming out on contracting â€” she has spent the last
3 years tracking down more data on the full scope of the contracting problem than anyone else and has done the most
sophisticated thinking about what we need to do. She has a book coming out from Yale University Press this fall; the
attached 2 pager summarizes her best thinking. She was supposed to brief Jack earlier this summer but it got canceled;
I'll have her down to talk to QDDR team. But meantime, given that issue is current right now, I thought S might benefit
from reading this.

Smart-Sourcing Diplomacy and Development
While most Americans do not know it, the business of foreign policy is increasingly in private hands. In 2000, the State
Department spent $1.3 billion on contracts and $102.5 million on grants. By 2008, grant spending had grown to $2.5
billion and contract spending had grown to $5.6 billion. In 2000, USAID spent $0 on grants[1] and $478.6 million on
contracts. By 2008, those figures had climbed to $5.2 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively (source: USAspending.gov[2]).
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759571 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759571 Date: 06/30/2015
Contracting is still perceived as something peripheral to policy itself, but when contracting and grants comprise 75
percent of State's total budget, as they did in 2008, that is clearly no longer the case.
The privatization trend predates the Bush Administration and is in part an appropriate response to globalization's
possibilities and more generally the changing nature of American power. But during the last eight years, laissez-faire
outsourcing to execute two ambitious wars carried the day, and oversight and management were often outsourced as
well as implementation. Today, the State Department and especially USAID are dependent on contractors, and
outsourcing, in turn, has remade the work environment for federal employees. Negative consequences are a private
sector that has been granted power without responsibility, a diminished and overtaxed DSS, a demoralized USAID, and
looming catastrophe in Iraq and Afghanistan, where reconstruction money first flowed into everyone's pockets except
those of ordinary citizens.
What is to be done? Smart-sourcing, not in-sourcing
To align our practices with our interests, the centrality of outsourcing to the contemporary business of government must
be properly acknowledged. America's allies today include a range of non-governmental actors, both for-profit and non-
profit, who are recipients of taxpayer dollars. While policy was once something that government devised (the ""what"")
and contractors executed (the ""how""), that is no longer the case in the information age. Especially in the development
realm, success or failure today turns on the how of US strategy, which effectively places a web of non-governmental
personnel in key policy-making positions. Since both development and democracy demand the engagement and
employment of local populations, turning the clock back and bringing whatever possible back in house would therefore
be a cure worse than the disease. We don't need a new prescription for our glasses; we need a new eye chart.
A smart-sourcing approach defines the ""how"" of policy as a strategic issue and proceeds on two fronts simultaneously.
First, smart-sourcing means building capacity for managing what OMB's July guidelines on contracting call the multi-
sector workforce. State Department contracting, programming, and information technology functions must be
redefined as collaborative ventures, so that State might more effectively orchestrate mission-oriented networks across
the public-private divide. Second, smart-sourcing involves identifying tasks that should never have been outsourced and
bringing those back in-house. It may be easiest to in-source according to political expediency, but that temptation must
be avoided. Clear guidelines for the limits of outsourcing must be delineated so that strategic rather than ad hoc choices
can be made. Both reforms have the virtue of directly advancing objectives outlined in OMB Director Peter Orszag's
July memoranda.
More specifically, a State Department committed to smart-sourcing should:
Support and promote OMB efforts to improve contracts and grants data quality, as well as the further
development of USA spending.gov to include subcontracts and subgrants. Transparency and accountability are the
critical values in a smart-sourcing orientation, and our anti-corruption efforts abroad will have enhanced credibility
when we are perceived to be upholding the same values at home.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759571 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759571 Date: 06/30/2015
Restructure USAID so that it has the capacity to manage its contracts as well as write checks. Capacity involves
more than FTE counts. State needs to recruit, train, and retain a workforce of twenty-first century network managers
who can ensure quality work at all stages of a given project.
Rebuild DSS so that State can phase out reliance on armed contractors in war zones. Our current practices blur the
line between the legitimate and illegitimate use of force, which is just what terrorists want.
Craft contracts that employ the foreigners we are trying to help. Sustainable development follows from the
bottom-up engagement of local populations, not top-down advice from US experts. A sense of local ownership is often
best fostered by foreign nationals written into contracts and grants rather than being directly employed by the USG.
Consider the lessons of the MCC and the expanded contributions of the NGO community in charting USAID's
future. Both devolve decision-making to the local level and involve a less prominent USG footprint. If organizations like
the Clinton Global Initiative and the Gates Foundation advance American interests more effectively than traditional
direct government intervention, overseas direct investment may be a dated policy instrument.
Follow the money and identify DOD reconstruction contracts that rightfully belonged in State's domain to bolster
the already compelling argument for greater civilian resources. There can be no smart power without smart-sourcing.
Bottom line: The information revolution has rendered big government vs. small government debates beside the point.
To paraphrase President Obama's inaugural address, we don't need a big State Department or a small State Department
but a State Department that works. A smart-sourcing approach to reform will strengthen the operational link between
policy and resources, enabling State to exploit all the networks at its disposal in ways that advance the interests of the
United States. Nothing could be more strategic.
[1] USAID's problematic accounting practices are currently on full public display at USAspending.gov. No data on grants
is provided for FY2000-2006.
[2] Data quality appears extremely variable, especially for USAID, but for general trends, it can suffice. I use 2008
numbers for the comparison, since 2009 aggregate numbers are still a moving target.

We are sad to be spreading the news of the passing of Marion Sinek, beloved mother, grandmother, and
friend, and tireless public servant. She believed in the dignity of each human being, respect for all, social justice, and
family.
The following text is the formal announcement of her passing:
Marion Sinek passed away peacefully on August 17, 2009 at age 78 after a long illness. She was born in
Berlin, Germany, and came to the US just before the beginning of WWII. She graduated from Forest Hills High School
and Syracuse University on a full scholarship. After graduate work at the London School of Economics, she worked for
Radio Free Europe and the UN Association-USA in NY. Marion became very active in public affairs, serving in various
roles for the League of Women voters, including President of the LWV of NY State. She later ran for office, serving for
eight years as a Town Board member in New Castle before becoming its Supervisor from 2000 to 2004. She later
worked with Sen. Hillary Clinton's office on election law issues, and remained active in Democratic politics and other
organizations. She served on the Compensation Advisory Panel to the Westchester County Board of Legislators, and
served on the boards of The Chappaqua Orchestra and the Holocaust and Human Rights Education Center. She lived in
Chappaqua for almost 38 years. She was predeceased by her husband Herbert; she is survived by her children Ron and
Nicole (Arnaboldi), their spouses Jennifer and Leo, and seven grandchildren. Burial will be private. A memorial will be
held in September. In lieu of flowers, donations in her memory may be made to the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center.
We know you join us in mourning the passing of a wonderful human being.

BusinessWeek Ranks Department of State #5 Best Place to Launch a Career: The Department ranked at the top
among federal agencies and #5 among all employers as one of the best places to begin a career. With an increase from
#12 last year to #5 this year, BusinessWeek ranked the Department in the Top 20 for the fourth consecutive year. The
ranking is based on a three-part methodology that includes combined survey data from careers services directors,
undergraduate students, and employers. For further information, please visit

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
DELOITTE & TOUCHE TOPS BUSINESSWEEK'S ANNUAL LIST OF
""BEST PLACES TO LAUNCH A CAREER""
New York, New York, September 3, 2009â€” The big four accounting firms once again dominate BusinessWeek's
fourth annual ranking of the ""Best Places to Launch a Career."" Deloitte & Touche jumped to the No.1 spot, unseating
Ernst & Young who ranked No.2. PricewaterhouseCoopers and KPMG took the third and fourth spot, respectively.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759596 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759596 Date: 06/30/2015
With rich benefits, extensive training programs, and a combined recruiting effort that makes more than 10,000
hires even in a tough year, the Big Four are hard to beat, and Deloitte is harder than most. With substantially higher
pay-18% of Deloitte's entry-level hires this year will earn north of $65,000â€”plus the industry's biggest signing bonuses
and most generous time-off policy, it's no wonder Deloitte is a favorite of students and career services directors. It
doesn't hurt that Deloitte's entry-level hiring took the smallest hit this year, down just 1.1% in the first half compared
with double-digit drops for No.2 Ernst & Young and No.4 KPMG.
To compile this ranking, BusinessWeek polled 60 college career services directors across the country; collected
data from a survey of 60,000 U.S. undergrads by Universum USA, a Philadelphia research company; and required
employers to submit statistics on everything from pay and benefits to training programs and retention. The number of
ranked employers is down sharply this year, owing to our decision to raise the bar on eligibility. And the tougher
competitionâ€”combined with a handful of new employers and shifts in sentiment among students and career services
directorsâ€”resulted in a shakeup in the standings.
Some companies, including No.11 Accenture and No.19 Prudential moved up more than 35 spots, while No.34
Marriott and No.48 Lockheed Martin were down 28 and 40 spots, respectively. Even the top 10 underwent big changes
this year. Marriott and Lockheed were out, as was Google, which declined to participate. But three new employers
entered the winner's circle. The State Dept. and Teach For America, which places college grads in troubled school
districts, are both in the midst of ramped-up recruiting campaigns, while J.P. Morgan, a unit ofJPMorgan Chase, reaped
a survivor's benefit: It's one of the few big investment banks left standing.
BusinessWeek's ""Best Places to Launch a Career"" ranking is in the September 14, 2009 issue, on newsstands
September 4th. Expanded content is available on BusinessWeek.com, including the full methodology, profiles of each
employer, an interactive table, slide shows, and a video roundtable with recruiters.

Congresswoman's son-in-law dies snorkeling
August 12, 2009 4:29 PM I UPDATED STORY
The son-in-law of U.S. Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-III.) died Sunday in a snorkeling accident as he vacationed in Mexico with
his family, her office and family said.
Michael McLaughlin, 38, was with Schakowsky and other family members near Tulum, Mexico, at the beginning of a
week long vacation, Schakowsky's husband Robert Creamer said.
McLaughlin was married to Lauren, 35, who is the daughter of Schakowsky's husband and his previous wife Day Piercy,
who lives in New York.
McLaughlin was a filmmaker and editor who lived with his wife in Queens, N.Y.
Creamer said he and other family members were in their hotel near Solinon Bay when another guest with binoculars
told them there appeared to be a problem with McLaughlin, who was snorkeling in the bay about 7 miles north of
Tul urn.
Creamer was the first to reach McLaughlin in a kayak. He said he found his son-in-law face down in the water, and called
out to him but got no response. Creamer said he got closer, turned his son-in-law over and realized he was in trouble. He
administered mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and put a life vest on him, Creamer said.
""I yelled at him and poked at him and got no response, so I turned him over and it was clear he wasn't breathing,"" said
Creamer.
McLaughlin's wife then showed up along with Schakowsky and others in more kayaks to help put McLaughlin on a kayak
in the nearly 7-feet of water. Others also arrived in more kayaks to assist and pulled the craft carrying McLaughlin onto
the beach where they continued to try to revive him unsuccessfully.
McLaughlin was pronounced dead at a local hospital a short time later, Creamer said.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759603 Date: 06/30/2015
In a phone interview from Mexico, Creamer said McLaughlin was an experienced snorkeler and diver who liked to
snorkel alone, a coroner's report said he had aspirated in his mask and died of asphyxiation, he said.
McLaughlin was cremated, following his own request, Creamer said.
Creamer described himself as heartbroken and praised his son-in-law and the 7-year marriage to his daughter. The
couple had planned to adopt their first child in September.
""Michael was one of the most loving and creative people I've ever met.... and he and my daughter Lauren had one of
the most loving marriages I have ever seen,"" Creamer said.
In 2005 Schakowsky's daughter-in-law Fiona died of cancer. She had been married to Schakowsky's son Ian.
Born Oct. 26, 1970, in Berkeley, Calif., McLaughlin was the oldest of three children and grew up in ""the shadow of Mount
Tamalpais, in Mann County,"" according to Creamer.
As a young man, McLaughlin was known for his love for the outdoors as his dinner table quips that entertained his
family. As a young adult, he attended Sarah Lawrence College where he studied theater and moved with a friend to New
York City, following college.
His family said McLaughlin never lost his zest for adventure, regularly white water rafting, skydiving, backpacking and
studying Karate.
McLaughlin later moved to San Francisco, where he met his wife Lauren and married her in July 2002. During their
marriage, McLaughlin helped his wife start her own business and she helped him pursue his film career as a filmmaker,
his family said.
During McLaughlin's career he worked in live theater, puppetry and short fiction. His short film ""Shadow Puppets of
Doom"" was shown in film festivals and won the ""Best Screenplay"" award in the Mann County Film Festival, his family
said. At the time of his death he was filming a pilot reality television show.
McLaughlin is survived by his wife, Lauren Creamer McLaughlin, his mother, Rohana, his sister, Halima, and his brother,
Marlin.

The US Ambassador to UNESCO is launching a fierce, ferocious, unfair campaign against the Egyptian candidate to
UNESCO Minister Farouk Hosni.
If Washington does not want him â€” for whatever reasons â€” this is acceptable as their choice, but we think the US, with
its principles and weight, should be a fair partner and an objective leader.
People here are surprised at the position of the US Ambassador. They say ""We want to feel that change is not just a
Motto but starts a new era in our relationship""
Hosni is an open-minded person who respects all religions. He is accused of being Anti-Jewish. That is not true. The
allegation is based on a quote out of context. He is translating Hebrew literature, restored Synagogues and is
establishing a Jewish Museum. He rescued the torah scrolls and has the symbols of the three religions appear together
in Video Clips, Pictures and documentaries about Egypt.
For these, and similar reasons, the fundamental â€” Terrorists are against him and are the ones working hard to block his
election.
Who wants to be with them in the same basket!!!!

Still working this through, but here is where we are thus far:
The majority of all countries that have direct presidential elections use a Two-Round system. The number appears to be
at least 58.
France, most Latin American countries, all five post-Soviet Central Asian republics, and many countries in francophone
Africa use TRS to elect their presidents. Elsewhere in Africa the system is used by Angola, Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana,
Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Sao Tome and Principe, the Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Sudan,
Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe; in Europe, apart from France, it is used by Armenia, Azerbaijan, Austria, Belarus,
Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Finland, Georgia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia
and Ukraine; and it is found in Afghanistan, Haiti, Indonesia, Iran, Timor-Leste and Yemen.

Even as Governor Paterson reportedly has his recommendation on the Aqueduct racino in hand (this reader says
that he actually has two to consider <http://leftatthegate.blogspot.com/2009/09/sunday-morning-notes-and-
nuts.html#comment-1156672372250588546> ), at least one of the bidders is still taking its case to the local community
around the track. The Queens Chronicle reported last week
<http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=20368289&BRD=2731&PAG=461&dept_id=574908&rfi=6> that SL
Green/Hard Rock made a presentation on Thursday.
""Hard Rock is the right balance,"" [Pres/CEO Marc] Holliday said. ""Its recognized brand and quality entertainment
will attract younger and older players across the stratum. People flying in from JFK will say, 'I hear there's a Hard Rock, I
want to see it.""
One of this group's big pitches is that they'll be the first to generate a revenue stream (""shovel-ready, in the
ground, the day after the award."")
And thanks to the reader who alerted us to this article in Crain's
<http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20090913/FREE/309139964> which, more importantly than comprising yet
another virtual press release for Steve Wynn, contains, towards the bottom, a handy pocket guide to the six bidders, the
financial portion of their bids (or at least what is known about them), and the ups and downs of their proposals.
This is a tough call; handicapping without the Form as I said before. I can't say I have a favorite; neither a
particular personal preference, nor a clue as to the most likely winner. But I'll give it a shot and take the Crain's piece
one step further by coming up with a morning line.
<http://1.bp.blogspot.com/yiJ1ri4LCfk/Sq2_nTNU jI/AAAAAAAABHM/UucITWnkilM/s1600-
h/dont_bother.jpg> Aqueduct Entertainment Group <http://www.aqueductentertainment.comk (3-1): Competitive bid
of $251 million (contingent on 7,650 machines; $301 million with 10,000), a plethora of local connections on the real
estate/construction side, and approval by local unions could compensate for the lack of brand name recognition of
gaming partner The Navegante Group. Presence of Senator Malcolm Smith's longtime confidante Rev. Floyd Flake
doesn't hurt either.
SL Green/Hard Rock (4-1) - Boosted its bid to $275 million, and has the Hard Rock brand name as mentioned
above. Manhattan-based realtor SL Green has been endorsed by several local unions
<http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3601/is_43_54/ai_n27894917/> . But, as mentioned by Crain's, they were
passed over in favor of Delaware North the first time around.
Aqueduct Gaming (6-1), Buffalo-based Delaware North's group, has rallied late with a stepped-up publicity effort
and a major community initiative <http://leftatthegate.blogspot.com/2009/08/back-in-game.html> after appearing
indifferent early on (though it's original $100 million upfront offer remains intact with an additional $200 million to
follow). The addition of Harrah's <http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/Aqueduct-Gaming-L1c-1034906.html>
adds an experienced operator and an interesting cross-marketing twist which is probably not allowed under the now-
disappeared MOU. And, like the two bidders above, Aqueduct Gaming has been reported to have reached
accommodations with the unions. So I listed them as the third choice on these merits. However, a part of me wants to
list them as the rank outsider - I'd be pretty damn shocked if the state goes back to the company which dropped out
after failing to raise the money last time. And, as I've mentioned several times, given the reports of an investigation
<http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2009/05/01/2009-05-
01_attorney_general_andrew_cuomo_subpoenas_contracts_won_by_clients_offirm_tied_to.html> by Attorney
General Andrew Cuomo into lobbyist Patricia Lynch's dealings with the Assembly Speaker, I don't know if her
involvement here is going to help or hurt.
Steve Wynn (8-1) has offered $300 million, but he was the only bidder of the six contenders to receive a bad
grade from the hotel unions <http://www.timesunion.com/AspStories/story.asp?storylD=838256&category=STATE> as
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759646 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759646 Date: 06/30/2015
reported by Jim Odato in the Times Union last week. Whatsmore, the scale of his building proposal
<http://www.queenstribune.com/news/1250798405.html> is laughably ridiculous, and it wouldn't be ready until 2011.
He'd be the favorite if the decision is based on the number of newspaper and online articles
<http://leftatthegate.blogspot.com/2009/08/all-wynn-all-of-time.html> each bidder has been featured in. But, quite
simply, he sometimes comes off as a nut
<http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/cindy_adams/wynn_hopes_to_win_racefor_race_hzqJ384wLxUSxFKsUWiSyM> .
Penn National (12-1) might be worth a ducat at long odds. No local connection here makes them a dark horse.
But a $250 million bid (as reported elsewhere <http://blog.timesunion.com/capitol/archives/17717/penn-national-
lobbies-up/> though not in the Crain's piece) puts them in the ballgame, and the company is an experienced gaming
operator with a solid balance sheet
<http://www.businessweek.com/investor/content/aug2009/pi20090814_742719.htm> which would probably do as
competent a job as anyone else.
R. Donahue Peebles/MGM Mirage (20-1) didn't increase its $150 million bid, and doesn't have a lobbyist; good
luck with that. Whatsmore, no local flavor and MGM Mirage has had some well-publicized financial woes (though things
have been looking up of late <http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125212120561188377.html> ). Would be a major
surprise.

Re: Branch Book
Overview:
There are few surprises in this book. The ""surprises"" that might exist are buried and took a close reading to pick up onâ€”
the two main ones are about the terror clause of WJC's crime bill and why he hadn't disclosed information about
Lewinsky (because he hadn't wanted to become a witness against her). There are a lot of things that have been covered
in My Life and other publications. Quite honestly the book was pretty boring and much more focused on Branch than I
had anticipated. While not as ""and this day, and the next day"" as My Life, it does share many of the same elements that
would engage only a true Clinton fanatic or historian. The fact that there appears to be no index also makes it difficult
for anyone looking for a quick hit to get one. Furthermore, WIC's words are so interlaced with Branch's recollection
through his dictations, that the number of direct WJC quotes was far fewer than I had expected.
HRC was not as much of a player as one might imagine. Her role is largely seen through her interactions with Branch
when he is recording WJC. Her statements were consistent with the past, with the exception of the Gephardt comment,
and didn't grab much attention at all.[1] (Others included HRC's devotion to CVC, thought that there should not be a
special prosecutor and images of her returning from meetings. They were pretty much aligned with her interactions with
Branch.) Surprisingly, or not surprisingly, many of the problems discussed in the book are those, which face the current
Administrationâ€”Middle East peace, North Korea, China, etc...
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759656 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759656 Date: 06/30/2015
Branch repeatedly injects his feelings on specific subjects and seems to use the book to voice his own opinion of the
Administration and events of the time. He clearly has topics he prefers over others (for example his connection with the
events in Haiti result in a lot of discussion about it), but there are some subjects that are strikingly sparsely discussed
such as Rwanda. Its absence from long discussions was surprising, but it did not appear as thought WJC ever-dodged
questions about the topic, they just weren't addressed. Much like My Life, one theme that repeated itself was WJC's
conflict with and disdain for the media, especially long passages about NYT and Washington Post. There are a few
instances where gives them credit on their reporting, but you would be hard-pressed to find them. Additionally, there
are numerous mentions of WJC's acute allergies and his chronic fatigue, with imagery of him falling asleep in sessions on
more than a couple occasions.
The book has quite a bit on Whitewater, but given the dearth of public documentation there is little that Branch could
write that hadn't been said. One thing I had not recalled was the D'Amato's subpoena of CVC's friends, later quashed,
who slept over while NBC's Rose Law Firm records were in the White House. Branch does portray a helpful distinction in
how WJC looked at Whitewater and other scandals. While WJC attacks Whitewater as a political hunt, Branch does have
him WJC saying that Filegate needed to be separated from Whitewater, because this was a legitimate inquiry. There are
some quips that could catch someone's eye, such as WJC referring to Paula Jones as ""a 'new bimbo' he [WJC] didn't
even recognize.""
Branch does not dwell on Lewinsky or the impeachment. With the exception of Bruce, Bennett and Kendall, no other
lawyers are mentioned. There is one passage that I am looking into, in which WJC says part of the reason he didn't
mention his relationship with Lewinsky at first was because she was being threatened with jail time if she was found to
be lying under oath and had he told the truth he could become a witness against her. This is a very small passage that
could easily be missed, but one that it is important to note as I don't recall hearing this before. (This is addressed more
fully below.)
There are a few relationships that track through the book more than others. They include WJC's relationship with Gore,
which maps in part because it is not a focal point until the end, and his contentious relationship with Janet Reno. The
one Senator that appears to be most discussed negatively is Moynihan. All three of these issues are discussed in turn
below. WJC is portrayed as an extremely loving and attentive father and HRC is portrayed in a much more human light
than other books/articles covering this time period, with ample mention of her relationship with CVC and images of
affection between her and WJC, both pre- and post-impeachment.
On foreign relations there is a lot of time spent discussing the Middle East, Northern Ireland, the Balkans, China, Russia,
Pakistan/India and in the beginning of the book, Haiti. (Note: Much of what is written about Haiti is about Branch's own
experience there and on the subject.) There is also a fair amount of discussion about North Korea, but nothing that has
not been discussed in the past few weeks. Bin Laden is discussed in what seems to track mention of him in My Life,
which seems to have more detail and background than this book.
In certain cases there is more detail here than in My Life, for example on his trip to Pakistan WJC wrote that the USSS
cancelled one stop because they would be ""defenseless"" flying in, whereas Brach writes that the streets would be lined

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759656 Date: 06/30/2015
with ""assassins."" There are candid looks at WIC's take on certain people and the relationship between some, such as
Albright and Berger's dislike of Holbrooke, and a more detailed depiction of Yeltsin's drinking, such as yelling outside of
Blair House for a cab to get pizza.
One thing to note, is that often times WJC seems to be speaking to Branch intentionally without the recorders going, but
Branch writes about those interactions and exchanges nonetheless. Such is the case with HRC's Gephardt comment.

Wen Ho Lee and Terror Clause of Crime Bill
In discussing Wen Ho Lee's release Branch characterizes WJC's lack of knowledge about the strained interpretation of
the anti-terrorist provisions in the crime bill and arbitrary detentions as a ""confession."" My Life only mentions Lee's
accusation in passing and does not again discuss Lee. Below are two passages from Branch's book the first giving context
and the second about the Terror Clause of the Crime Bill.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759656 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759656 Date: 06/30/2015
0 The year closed on spies and terrorism. The Justice Department, after fierce debate among the security agencies,
indicted nuclear scientist Wen Ho Lee on fifty-nine counts of copying classified material to his personal computer. Lee
was being handled like a radioactive espionage defendantâ€”no bail, lockdown, solitary confinementâ€”even though the
long dragnet had produced no evidence that he offered secrets to China or anyone else. The president said experts were
telling him the worst spies sometimes stored their treason for a rainy day. This sounded fishy to me. Clinton shrugged.
Nothing would please him more than to establish Lee's innocence. [Branch, 577]
0 While Lee was indicted, Branch writes that WJC noted that others ""were being held in secret, uncharged and
untried...He [WIC] was embarrassed not to have sponsored this measure into law without foreseeing such arbitrary
detentions...Under the terrorist act, any prosecutor should decide within the legal limit...whether to bring charges on the
testimony of a secret informant or otherwise. To his dismay, Clinton had learned of defendants held incommunicado for
more than six months. One extreme detention had last three years. 'I think it's wrong,' he [WJC] said. 'It's not American.
We accept guilty people on the street to enjoy and protect our freedom."" [Branch, 629]
WJC and Lewinsky's Silence
Branch writes that part of WJC's motive for not discussing what had happened with Lewinsky was that it could send her
to jail, as she had denied it.
0 ""Also, he pointed out that Starr had been threatening to jail Lewinsky all year over her sworn denial of the affair. If
Clinton had come forward with anything at all about their relationship, he said Starr could have turned him into a
witness against Lewinsky, betraying her discreet silence. Such subtleties, while original, struck me as tendentious. The
president never claimed chivalry as the real motive for his steadfast denial, nor did he dispute the essential truth of
Lewinsky's account."" [Branch, 511]
HRC and Kissinger
The following could be fodder for people who want to continue to string along the notion of channeling Eleanor
Roosevelt.
0 There is a passage in which HRC describes an exchange she had with Kissinger at a dinner where he complained that
if the health care bill passed he wouldn't be able to see his own doctor. She continued to say ""it was interesting, in fact,
that she had dreamed about Kissinger only a few nights before. His visage turned suddenly effervescent at a banquet,
announcing gladly that his worries were over because the Clinton health care bill was dying. 'Oh, no, Dr. Kissinger,' she
replied coolly. 'Don't be sure that it's dead. We'll keep fighting, and there's always light at the end of the tunnel.' She
said Kissing blanched, speechless at her deft reminder of the Vietnam War...Now at last, in Hillary's dream, it registered
that his strategic designs had spewed carnage and venom for seven needless years...'That's what I dreamed,' Hillary
repeated, lost in thought. 'You know, I always get my revenge in dreams, but never in real life."" [Branch, 179]

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759656 Date: 06/30/2015
HRC and gay/lesbian
Writing about a call with HRC from NYS, Branch recalls how W1C's counsel got very ""exercised."" WJC left the room. ""He
was subdued on his return. 'You know, I've had a lot more contact with gay people in my life than Hillary.' He sighed. Her
temperament had a conservative, religious core, formed before homosexual issues were even mentionable. New York
politics was a tough crucible, and she was unsure what heat she could take. On the other hand, personal experience
could speed adaptation."" [Branch, 551]
Tension with Moynihan
There are several occasions throughout the book that Branch recalls WJC's grievances and frustration with Moynihan.
For example:
0 When Moynihan called for the international arms embargo to be unilaterally lifted so that Bosnia could fight for
themselves, Branch writes, ""The president flinched when I mentioned [it]...'That's just a freebie for him,' snapped
Clinton, 'and he knows it."" [p.140]
0 In regard to health care: ""Echoing comments by Hillary at dinner, he [WIC] faulted Senator Moynihan for aimless
hearings conducted without a strategy or theme."" [p.170]
0 Discussing Independent Counsel: ""She [HRC] was especially scornful of the Democrats, and quoted a number of
them. Senator Moynihan, for instance, publicly said the Clintons were nice people and he was sure they had nothing to
hide. 'Why not have an investigation?' he often asked. She said Moynihan skated blithely on the surface, never
produced results in Congress, and could not withstand such scrutiny himself for five minutes, living in an apartment
secured through his chairmanship of the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation."" [Brach, 182]
0 ""Donnybrook"" argument in which Moynihan said of a fundraising speech WJC gave citing a regretted hypothetical
about a controversial decision. Moynihan told the press, ""He doesn't understand...that he's conceding the principles.""
WJC confronted him about lack of context given to the statement to the press and said that Moynihan knew what he
was doing by ""feeding the beast of hostile presumption about Clinton's motives."" [Branch, 299]
HRC as World Player
There are several images as HRC as a player on the world stage, both with WJC and on her own. Several examples
follow:
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759656 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759656 Date: 06/30/2015
0 Middle East: Discussing peace with King Hussein: ""They had retreated for lunch as two couplesâ€”the Clintons, with
the king and his wife, Queen Noorâ€”in the family dining room...Their agenda was a delicate race between Hussein's
failing health and his desire to make peace with Israel. The president said he and Hillary pounded away on symptoms of
national estrangement: closed boarders, water disputes, travel barriers, war grievances, contested airspace, sealed
electrical grids, and so on. Hussein gave them a feast of goodwill without commitment on any point."" [Branch, 170]
0 South Asia: Regarding her trip to South Asia with CVC in 1995, ""Her [HRC's] schedule was far more demanding than
ceremonial, pushing both conflict resolution and civic empowerment for downtrodden women."" [Branch, 236] Later
Branch tells of Benazir Bhutto praising CVC and HRC. ""By contrast with a superficial American press, which portrayed
Hillary as a demure tourist of no policy significance in exotic Asia, Bhutto said she had touched essential political chords
with whirlwind encouragements for citizenship groups and small-scale economic development."" (The note contrasting
Bhutto corresponds to a NYT article which Branch quotes in the footer saying, ""she [HRC] played the traditional role of
First Lady as wife and mother..."") [Branch, 246]
0 China Speech: Branch outlines how HRC felt the speech needed to be bigger than China and how she depicted the
""harsh reality everywhere"" from China to Africa. He then cites WJC commenting on the rave reviews of HRC's speech.
[Branch, 289]
0 Regarding the Russian financial system meltdown, Branch writes ""Yeltsin seemed so removed from urgent political
tasks that both Clintons counseled him directly."" [Branch, 512-513]
Jesse Jackson
Branch writes about Jesse Jackson calling CVC after the Lewinsky story broke and having continued contact with her
throughout the period. WJC thanks him for his support of CVC. This goes into some detail about WJCs gratitude, but the
fact that Jackson ""counseled"" CVC has been public knowledge dating back to at least 1999.
0 ""But now Jesse had done something he would not forget. When the Lewinsky news broke, he called Chelsea at
Stanford. Jesse was the only nonfamily adult with her cell phone number. How he got it was another story. Jesse said he
knew this was terrible for her. Nothing like it had ever happened in American politics. He did not know everything
involved, but he wanted to remind Chelsea how much her parents loved her. Their family needed to stick together now
above all, and if she needed to counsel, rage, or pray, he was always available."" [Branch, 497]
Tension with Janet Reno
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759656 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759656 Date: 06/30/2015
Throughout the book, from his nomination of her, WJC is portrayed as having no opinion to having a negative opinion of
Janet Reno.
0 ""He complained about Janet Renoâ€”made it clear, in fact, that he felt alienated from his own attorney general. If he
removed her, however, the pending decision on yet another special prosecutor [for 1996 campaign finance] would fall
to Reno's deputy, Jamie Gorelick, who, Clinton feared, may share Reno's wholesale devotion to outside control for any
case in which the president himself may become a target...lf he removed both Reno and Gorelick, to start fresh, it would
touch off a firestorm of protest like Nixon's Saturday Night Massacre of the Justice Department officials during the
Watergate scandal. That was not an option."" [Branch, 388-389]
0 Branch writes about WJC talking about Reno and Louis Freeh disregarding a letter from D'Amato and continuing to
allow independent counsel to go after Ciseneros. The same held true for Mike Espy. Branch then outlines a meeting
between WJC and Reno. Reno had made public statements about her ""desire to stay on the job. 'I told her I didn't like
that one damn bit,' the president said tersely. 'I didn't hire her to work for the New York Times and Washington Post. I
hired her to work for me."" [Branch, 398] He continues to outline that Clinton did give Reno credit for some good
achievements including coordination with U.S. attorneys and that he didn't blame her for the special prosecutor on
Whitewater, but that ""he did blame her for abdicating responsibility to supervise the investigations ever since, letting
mandates multiply almost at will. She accepted criteria that were ludicrous and crassly partisan. Reno had failed to
defend the presidency itselfâ€”not Clinton personally, but the institutionâ€”and by extension the entire executive
branch...He told me she had no clue what he meant. His advisers considered her more naÃ¯ve than upright, and the
fuzziness of the distinction seemed to save her."" [Branch, 399] He cites that Clinton warned her that she should prepare
herself for not staying in the job for the entire second term.
Portrayal of Jimmy Carter
There are parallels that could be drawn between WJC/BHO and Carter/WJC both in terms of Carter's trip to North Korea
and the mission he went on to Haiti. WJC clearly was frustrated by Carter's seeming desire to be on the front lines.
North Korea:
0 ""On North Korea, he [WJC] said Jimmy Carter had initiated his own recent trip with a call to Al Gore, and Clinton had
approved the volunteer mission to break through North Korea's extreme isolation...Sure enough, Carter did reach North
Korean dictator Kim II-sung, who proposed to allow inspection of North Korea's nuclear facilities in exchange for relief
from the harsh economic sanctions. The only hitch was that Carter announced the terms on CNN before they became
official, adding gratuitously that he never had agreed with sanctions in the first place. News stories had the White House
seething, but Clinton made light of the spat. He said the deal was since ratified by an exchange of letters, and he did not
believe Carter would criticize official policy 'if the game were still in doubt."" [Branch, 1621
Haiti:

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759656 Date: 06/30/2015
0 After pushing to be sent to Haiti and enlisting Colin Powell and Sam Nunn to get WJC to break with Gore (who said
Carter shouldn't be trusted a second time) and Christopher and approve the mission to Haiti to seek a truce with the
junta, Carter is portrayed as acting stubbornly and having 'clientitis' (arguing for acceptance of Haitian generals versus
what was in the United States' best interest). He didn't want to leave and WJC told him he had to. Like after North
Korea, Carter again, Carter went to the press first. ""The three negotiators flew back to Washington late Sunday, and
Carter, invited to stay over at the White House, called CNN's Judy Woodruff after midnight to arrange an interview the
next morning before he reported to Clinton on his mission. This conduct, the president said tersely, was not right...The
press was full of retrospective stories about friction between him and his three prominent negotiators... He said the
current newsweeklies lapped up criticism by Carter as an embarrassment to Clinton...Many of his advisers griped that
Jimmy Carter thought he was still president, but Clinton found this criticism too jaundiced. Carter had spoken with
restraint at their joint press conference, he allowed, exhibiting a keen political ear...To Clinton, Carter simply felt that he
had earned the right to speak his mind as an international statesman, even about a mission he had accepted for the
United States government complete with an Air Force jet. This sense of entitlement could make Carter a thorn, but
Clinton thought his value far outweighed the political annoyance. He considered Carter a sterling ex-resident."" [Branch,
200-201]
Dispatch of Bombers Near Iraq
0 ""He expected military strikes to win bipartisan assent, including former presidents Ford, Reagan and Bush. 'Dole will
support me,' he said. 'Carter will probably criticize me. Carter always criticizes, but he doesn't have much positive to
say."" [Branch, 518]
Gore
For the majority of the book, there is little discussion of WJC and Gore's relationship. There are few places where he is
briefly mentioned and a couple of scenes with some levity. The end, however, describes the seemingly brutally candid
conversation between the two about the 2000 election and the impeachment.
0 On page 92 Branch writes, ""No, he [Clinton] did not ask Gore to take over a failed foreign policy, as alleged, but to
improve public presentations by his troika of 'bad talkers': shy National Security Adviser Tony Lake, boring Secretary of
State Warren Christopher, and disorganized Defense Secretary Les Aspin."" [Branch, 92]
0 In one-passage WJC talks about asking Gore to lead the independent review of Hazel O'Leary and also having Gore
substitute for him at an economic conference in Japan. The latter did not fare well as other nations were offended that
Gore, not WJC attended. Gore insisted that WJC needed to go to Japan to redeem himself and the administration for his
absence. Gore pointed to a few days in January, but WJC ""pronounced them vital to Chelsea's schoolwork. Gore blinked.
So what?...Mutual exasperation spiked. 'Al,' Clinton told him, 'I am not going to Japan and leave Chelsea by herself to
take these exams.' Gore erupted. He thought Clinton had lost his bearing. They had a big fight, said the president, and
were still wrangling about dates for Japan."" Branch states that this fight wound up being around the time WJC saw
Lewinsky. [Branch, 316-317]

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759656 Date: 06/30/2015
0 On page 396-397 there is a scene, which shows Gore's sense of humor and Gore, WJC, et al working as a team to
secure the Cabinet for the second term.
0 Later there is a passage about an exchange between WJC and HRC about Gore trying to hire a second criminal
lawyer. HRC already knew he was paying the first one $30,000 per month. The conversation is about a leak of an offer
from Jim Neal of TN, the former Watergate prosecutor to defend Gore for free. The exchange is more on ethics of the
offer and its leak to the press than about Gore.
0 On Gore's announcing his campaign. ""The president had called twice to congratulate Gore for his kickoff eventsâ€”
once from Geneva, hours later from Paris. Clinton thought the only glitches were technical...But Gore got all the big
things right. His twofold message was perfect: distinguish himself from Clinton's personal flaws, and tell voters exactly
what he would do for them in the White House. The president said it was fine for Gore to call Clinton's affair with
Monica Lewinsky 'inexcusable.' First, it was true. Second, it showed a necessary strength to criticized the boss. Third,
Gore would be badgered to death until he did. 'Al,' Clinton told him, 'if you thought it would help in the campaign, I
would let you flog me at noon right on the doorstep of the Washington Post."" [Branch, 553-554] Branch continues that
WJC told Gore to ignore reporting that he was offended or critical of his campaign. ""On tape, the president said he
confided his chief strategic worry only to Gore himself and to Gore's pollster, Mark Penn. The vice president must
project his platformâ€”where he stood, precisely how and where he would lead the countryâ€”because the Republicans
would try to knock him off substance."" [Branch, 554]
0 WJC offered critiques of Gore's campaign throughout, but it was always framed as his fear of Gore not succeeding
him. For example, ""Clinton still thought Gore could win. Most people considered him smart, experience, and motivated.
He examined the pitfalls for Gore in a campaign showcasing presidential character over detailed agendas for the
country. Reporters called Gore ""stiff,"" but Clinton discounted this liability. He thought Gore's droll sense of humor would
wear well over time. Gore also was perceived to be too conventional a Democrat, therefore lacking independence,
which called for Gore to emphasize more his own passion and initiatives. Then the president said Gore could have a
brooding quality about him, not worrisome or off-putting in itself, but potentially damaging if his serious nature failed to
give voters a lifted. Clinton isolated the word ""sunny."" Gore needed more of it."" [Branch, 599]
0 He also complimented Gore's knowledge of government workings. ""Gore knew Washington. Believe me, said the
president, his administration would have made many more errors in the first two years had it not been for the vice
president."" He then goes on to say that WJC suggested Gore find someone who would be a bright spot to run with,
perhaps Durbin or Bradley or Kerrey, although he also goes into great detail about the virtues of Mikulski, even though
she would never get chosen. How much of this was WJC's emphasis versus Branch's focus on his home state senator is
unclear. [Branch, 599, 618-19]
0 WJC criticized Gore for not running on the successes of the administration. ""They should be running essentially for a
third term, said the president, but they were afraid the Clinton-Gore record would tarnish them with Clinton's
character."" [Branch, 623] Branch gives WJC's critique of Gore in debate that had been heard beforeâ€”that Gore lacked
style and a light touch.

0 Branch has WJC recalling a conversation between WJC and Gore where ""Gore had bared himself in one of their
stressful consultations by insisting that he, Gore, was a good politician, elaborating that he meant good on the policy,
and also good on the politics, but admitted that he did not instinctively blend the two. Gore said he had to think about
it, and Clinton thought this was pretty close to the bone...He had the stuff to be a great president, and this was the
message that Clinton must convey somehow without seeming to brag on his own record."" [Branch, 623-624]
0 The big passage about Gore begins on page 641 and extends to 645. Branch notes that WJC was unsure at first
about recording the details. At the outset it says, ""For his own part, Gore was not angry, nor did he blame Clinton for his
defeat, but he wanted to acknowledge forthrightly that some people around him did."" [Branch, 642] It has WJC
acknowledging that Gore's use of him was properâ€”he was best in the White House. Then he says, ""I think you made a
mistake not to use me more in the last ten days,"" Clinton told Gore, 'but otherwise that was not a big deal. I was much
more upset about your message, now that we're being honest."" [Branch, 642] Branch recalls WJC saying Gore fought
bag saying that ""Clinton's drag plagued every direction."" Clinton then said that Gore was better at governance than
Clinton, and Gore would be better for the nation than Bush, and that he was an ""unparalleled"" vice president, but that
he had ""blind spots."" Branch writes that WJC kept saying their confrontation was ""surreal.""
o Gore had a ""fresh grievance...he wanted Clinton to know that the Buddhist temple fund-raising scandal had been
the worst experience of his life. No one had ever questioned his personal integrity, but corrosive publicity and whispers
had tormented him now for four years. Gore said he had not been disposed to blame Clinton. However, he remembered
telling the president that he found himself the only English-speaking person at one of those Asian fund-raisers. And the
president was in charge of the party apparatus that was supposed to screen all the donations for trouble. So he did
blame Clinton in a way. The president told me he could scarcely believe the ensuing tales of suspicion. Gore must still be
in shock from the election, or unhinged. 'I thought he was in Neverland,' he said."" [Branch, 643-644]
o Branch continues: ""The vice president asked Clinton about Monica Lewinsky. He had supported Clinton all through
the impeachment, publicly and privately, while declaring himself disappointed. Yes, said the president. He appreciated
that. However, persisted Gore, Clinton did not confide any personal feelings. He never explained exactly what happened.
There was little to say, Clinton replied, beyond failure and regret. He was humiliated and angry, had made mistake. He
had misled the American people, and he was sorry. Gore closed his point with emphasis. Well, he said, this is the first
time you have apologized to me personally. Clinton did a double take...Gore treated the confession as a watershed.
Their colliding perspectives made both of them angry. Clinton exploded that Gore's reaction was phony. What was so
significant here?...Gore exploded back. He was feeling a stubborn repeat of the defensiveness and delayed honesty that
somehow cost the election. Clinton's character was at the root of it..."" [Branch, 644-45]

0 Maggie as Person Recommending Panetta: Unlike in My Life, in Branch's book, it has WJC asking Maggie to compile
confidential suggestions for McLarty's replacement. ""Williams was shrewd, discreet, and efficient."" [Branch, 161]
HRC and Haiti Invasion: Branch asked WJC what HRC thought about his foreign policy team's suggestion to invade
Haiti. ""He said the pell-mell rush to invade was crazy to her. Reacting against the pressure, the lack of options, and his

sense of being trapped, she said he was badly served by his foreign policy staff. He said she observed with some
suspicion that the chief sponsors of the invasionâ€”Lake, Berger, and Talbottâ€”were the same people who had pushed
the ill-fated appointment of Bobby Ray Inman as defense secretary."" [Branch, 189]
0 ITAV: ITAV co-author flap in which Sally Quinn spread rumors that HRC had not written the book. Quinn said that
HRC had denied credit to the book's collaborator, Barbara Feinman, a friend of Quinn. HRC said Feinman had withdrawn
from the project. Branch notes that the White House had draft chapters in HRC's handwriting. (Branch turned this to be
about him and how it affected him as a ghostwriter.) From this HRC said that Quinn and her friends launched a rumor
that HRC and a female veterinarian of Socks' were ""discovered...in flagrante on a bedroom floor in the White House.""
[Branch, 342-343]
0 Subpoenas of CVC's Friends: Branch tells of how D'Amato, as Chair of the Banking Committee, had subpoenaed all
those who might have been in the White House when HRC's Rose firm records were there. This included ""some two
dozen of Chelsea's sleepovers."" Senator Sarbanes quashed the subpoenas for the sleepovers. [Branch, 362]
0 Vernon Jordan Extramarital Sex: In the context of Lewinsky, Branch says of Vernon Jordan, ""In our glancing
associations, I had picked up from Vernon an attitude toward extramarital sex best described as lighthearted or
recreational."" [Branch, 495]
0 Gore/HRC ticket: ""By the numbers, and Clinton's gut, a Gore-Hillary ticket would give Democrats their best chance
to defeat Bush for the White House. 'Hands down,' he [WJC] said, 'but I don't think Al would ever do it."" [Branch, 540]
WJC suggesting Rubin run for NY Senate seat: The passage comes after WJC talks about supporting HRC if she
decided to run, which raises a question of whether he had preferred Rubin or whether the two events are unconnected.
""When the president had urged him [Rubin] to run for and easily win the New York Senate seat, Rubin recoiled...He .
could not fathom why Hillary wanted to run now..."" [Branch, 557]
0 On trip to South Asia: Branch says that WJC agreed to cancel a stop in Bangladesh, because ""of hard intelligence
that Osama bin Laden had lined the route with assassins."" [Branch, 594] My Life discusses the cancelled trip but does
not specify it was because of bin Laden or assassins.

Thanks, Hillary. I don't know about details of Obama's plan, but you looked terrific at the speech. (Lincoln, in 1864, on
Obama's plan: ""The difficulty is not in stating the principle, it is in applying it."") Too bad Rep. Wilson didn't wear a red
pantsuit.
Max continues to rocket--up to #8 overall this am, #1 in every nonfiction category except cookbooks. And last night in an
special election Jackie was elected Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner in DC. It was a hard fought race, in fact, and
her opponent ran a negative campaign against her on email with the slogan: ""She's Not Jackie.""
Here's the draft of the article Max has written on the bad Joe Wilson (membership in racist organization) and that will be
published today. This should do it.
Let's speak when you have time.
Rep. Joe Wilson's Rebel Yell
Inside the racist klavern that Joe Wilson joined By Max Blumenthal
Since Republican Rep. Joe Wilson of South Carolina bellowed at President Barack Obama, ""You lie!"" during the
president's nationally televised speech on healthcare, the fourth term backbencher has emerged as a hero among the
conservative grassroots. One of the most enthusiastic endorsements of Wilson's histrionics came from the Sons of
Confederate Veterans (SCV), a group that Wilson has <a href=http://crooksandliars.com/david-neiwert/obama-heckler-
joe-wilson-member-neo>belonged to</a> for several years.
""Mr. Wilson, never apologize for allowing your love of truth to overrun your desire to be polite,"" the SCV Tea Party <a
href=http://scvteaparty.com/?p=165>declared</a> on its website. ""It is the liar who must apologize, not the one who
identifies the liar!""
Who are the SCV? A once-proud organization of Confederate history buffs and re-enactors who spent their
organization's money to restore Civil War-era battlefields and Confederate cemeteries, by 2006 the SCV was
substantially <a href=http://www.spIcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?pid=1027 >taken over</a> by an organized
cadre of white supremacist radicals (read <a href=http://www.spIcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?pid=154
>here</a> for more background) who sought to turn the nation's oldest Southern historical society into what the
veteran white supremacist activist Kirk Lyons called ""a modern, 21st century Christian war machine capable of uniting
the Confederate community and leading it to ultimate victory."" When the racist junta had seized much of the SCV's
leadership positions, the Southern Poverty Law Center released an <a

href=http://www.spIcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?sid=90 >extensive list</a> of SCV officials who belonged to
""hate groups.""
Lyons, a key leader of the white supremacists who took over the SCV, had <a
href=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20050829/blumenthal/single >harbored dreams</a> of creating a seemingly
benign front group for a more sophisticated version of the Ku Klux Klan. ""I have great respect for the Klan historically,
but, sadly the Klan today is ineffective and sometimes even destructive,"" Lyons told a German neo-Nazi magazine in
1992. ""It would be good if the Klan followed the advice of former Klansman Robert Miles: 'Become invisible. Hang the
robes and hoods in the cupboard and become an underground org anization."" With the SCV, Lyons discovered he didn't
have to go underground after all.
Once Lyons helped install his close friend, Ron Wilson, as president of the SCV, the organization's political newsletter, <a
href=http://fpacscv.org/southernmercury/ >The Southern Mercury</a> (where Wilson served as senior editor),
transformed into a propaganda mill for crude white supremacist cant. Mailed to all dues-paying members of the SCV â€”
presumably including Rep. Joe Wilson â€” until it went defunct in 2008, the Mercury has published articles describing
blacks as genetically inferior to whites, calling African-Americans as ""a childlike people,"" and warned that if Obama runs
for re-election, race riots of an ""exceedingly violent nature"" would immediately ensure, leaving ""entire sections of some
of our cities in ruins.""
Here are a few highlights from the Southern Mercury:
""After the turn of the 20th century, the white Southerners had disfranchised and segregated the blacks, in perhaps the
mildest reaction possible at=2 Othat time to the blacks' transgressions. The blacks â€” then a childlike people â€” had been
selling their votes to the Democrats en masse for $.25 apiece in national elections.""
â€”""Where We Stand Now, And How We Got Here,"" by Frank Conner, Southern Mercury, September/October 2003
""Previously, anthropologists had routinely recorded the notable differences in IQ among the races; but at Columbia, a
liberal cultural anthropologist named Franz Boas...decreed that there were no differences in IQ among the races, and the
only biological differences between the blacks and whites were of superficial nature... Meanwhile, the liberals in the
media heaped special praise upon black athletes, musicians, singers, and writers â€” and treated them as typical of the
black race. The liberals were creating a false image of the blacks in America as a highly competent people who were
being held back by the prejudiced white Southerners.""
--Conner, September/October 2003
""It is very clear to me that if Barack Obama should be elected President, he would be extremely anti-white and would
demand reparations for slavery and press hard for affirmative action to the degree that it would hurt young whites who
were seeking jobs or admission to College and Graduate Schools.""
â€”
""Americans Face The Worst Presidential Candidates In History,"" by Robert Slimp, Southern Mercury, May/June 2008
""I believe that [Obama's] rhetoric and anti-white legislative proposals would stir up racial riots. If he were running for re-
election, these riots would turn into an exceedingly violent nature that would seriously damage race relations in
America, and leave entire sections of some of our cities in ruins.""
--Slimp, May/June 2008
Rep. Joe Wilson could have resigned from the SCV as soon as the organization's takeover by open white supremacists
began. But he didn't. Or he could have withdrawn his membership when the SCV's flagship journal turned into a racist
rag. But he didn't. Instead, while serving as a state senator, Wilson led an SCV-inspired campaign in 2000 to keep the
Confederate flag flying above South Carolina's state capitol. ""The Southern heritage, the Confederate heritage, is very
honorable,"" Wilson <a href=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/503579.stm>proclaimed</a> at the time, responding
to critics of the Confederate flag.

A New Approach for Missile Defense
By Hillary Clinton
Iran's development of short- and medium-range ballistic missiles poses a clear and growing threat to the security of our
European allies and our own forces stationed in the region. That is why President Obama announced yesterday that the
United States is ready to deploy missile defenses in Europe specifically geared toward stopping these missiles. This is a
threat we cannot ignore.
Previous missile defense efforts have focused on protecting against intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching
the United States, but our intelligence now shows that the threat from these long-range weapons has not progressed as
quickly as had been feared. In contrast, evidence indicates that Iran is developing short- and medium- range missiles
that will eventually enable it to target most of Europe, the Caucuses and the Middle East, including U.S. and NATO
forces.
We deeply appreciate the willingness of the Czech and Polish Governments to host the original missile defense
architecture on their soil, and the decision to deploy other systems to better meet this growing threat came as a result
of a long and careful review of our policies, capabilities, and requirements. This decision does not alter the unshakeable
commitment of the United States to the security of these vital NATO allies. Rather, it reflects our determination to
jointly meet the threats that endanger us all.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759705 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759705 Date: 06/30/2015
The old focus on long-range missile defense systems left significant gaps in our ability to defend against shorter-range
threats, exposing our allies and our forces stationed in Europe. Many experts have also expressed concerns about the
testing record and effectiveness of the long-range interceptors that were to be deployed in Poland.
Our new approach is different in a number of ways.
First, we will use well-tested missile defense systems, such as the Standard Missile-3, against the current threats. And
unlike the old fixed, silo-based interceptors, they will be mobile and able to shift as threats evolve.
Second, while previous efforts sought to by-pass NATO in favor of bilateral agreements, the Obama Administration plans
to make coordination with NATO a central element of our approach. By working with our allies to build a workable and
cost-effective missile defense system in Europe, we can better contribute to the protection of our NATO allies and
increase regional stability.
For 60 years, the NATO alliance has been a force for peace, prosperity and security in Europe and around the world
because of its commitment to collective security: an attack on one ally is an attack on all. An attack on London or
Warsaw is an attack on New York or Washington. NATO demonstrated this commitment after the September 11
terrorist attacks, when for the first time, the alliance invoked Article V and NATO sent assets to the United States to help
protect us from additional terrorist attacks.
Unfortunately, the old long-range defense plan created the impression of ""two-tiers"" of security within the alliance by
focusing only on theoretical threats that could one day affect the mainland United States, while leaving our European
allies vulnerable to very real short- and medium-range missiles.
Our new plan corrects this imbalance. We will continue to monitor and counter longer-term threats, but we will work
with our allies to protect all NATO territory. We will focus on the most imminent threat, while also developing the
capacity to adjust quickly if the threat evolves.
Finally, we will engage with Russia as part of our new approach. Russia is also vulnerable to Iran's short- and medium-
range missiles and we will seek to cooperate to address this common threat. I am pleased that the Russians agreed at
the Moscow Summit to a joint threat assessment of the ballistic missile challenges of the 21st century, including from
Iran. This is a positive first step and I look forward to future progress.
In short, this new missile defense plan is more realistic about the threats we face, more reliable in the tools we will use,
and more inclusive of the allies we are pledged to protect.
While we pursue this new path, we will also redouble our diplomatic efforts to engage Iran and focus its leaders on a
clear choice: whether to join the international community as a responsible member or to continue down a path to
further isolation.
But the security of our allies and our forces cannot wait. That is why we are moving ahead with a new approach for
missile defense.

Subject: (WSJ) U.S. to Shelve Nuclear Missile Shield
WASHINGTON (Wall Street Journal) - The White House will shelve Bush administration plans to build a missile-defense
system in Poland and the Czech Republic, according to people familiar with the matter, a move likely to cheer Moscow
and roil the security debate in Europe. The U.S. will base its decision on a determination that Iran's long-range missile
program has not progressed as rapidly as previously estimated, reducing the threat to the continental U.S. and major
European capitals, according to current and former U.S. officials.

Heads up. Richard invited George to go on one of his recent AfPak. I endorsed it as did the White House because George
is a first-rate journalist. Obviously Richard strayed shall we say from discussion of our strategy. It ends up being a semi-
profile on Richard. I'll alert the WH. I don't see anything here that is problematic for the Secretary, but I don't know that
every detail here is correct.

Dear Mr. Crowley,
The New Yorker Magazine is going to press with George Packer's article on Richard Holbrooke. George briefly mentions
Secretary Clinton in the piece. I am fact-checking the piece and want to make sure our information is accurate. If you

1. Secretary Clinton told George Packer that the Administration was coordinating diplomatic and development and
defense efforts much more closely than it had before.
2. In 1996, Secretary Clinton encouraged her husband to name the first female Secretary of State.
3. Last year at the transition headquarters at the Hilton Hotel in Chicago, Obama asked Hillary Clinton about
possible candidates for the the position of Secretary of State.
4. Clinton recommend Holbrooke to Obama.
5. A few days after Obama offered Clinton the position of Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton called Holbrooke to
offer him the job that is now called Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan.
6. In late November, HRC and Holbrooke talked for three hours at Essex House, in New York, about the job.
7. Early on, Clinton told Holbrooke that he would be the civilian counterpart to General David Petraeus.
8. Clinton introduced Holbrooke to Petaeus.
9. Holbrooke initially told Clinton that he would need around 15 staff members in his department.
10. Holbrooke told HRC last fall that he would prefer the title Special Representative to Special Envoy.
11. Holbrooke and Clinton often speak several times a day.
12. On April 23rd at 4 pm, Clinton, Donilon and Holbrooke met the President at the Oval Office.
13. In the hallway, fifteen minutes before the meeting began, Holbrooke gave Clinton and Donilon a memo written
by his staff member, Vali Nasr.
14. Clinton read the memo in the hallway.
15. Clinton gave a copy to the President after they walked into the Oval Office.
16. Holbrooke has praised Clinton's idea of tapping the Pakistani diaspora. She has urged Pakistani-American
doctors, especially women, to volunteer in the refugee areas.

Subject: Negotiations with Iran
After much back and forth, the speech does not affirmatively indicate our willingness/openness to explore talking about
other issues with Iran. Bill's recommendation is that if you are asked about it, you should say we are open to exploring
other subjects in addition to the nuclear file, but that you should not state that affirmatively.

Hello Melanne,
Well the list of 5 continues to be a Quizomba dance (a bit forward, a bit backward).
On the positive.
The two, Mosala and Pitchen, that had been commanders in Kimia II, have finally been changed. They are
supposedly in route to Kinshasa.
That means none of the 5 are now in active operational command position.
This is positive.
All 5 are supposedly in Kinshasa, but not yet confirmed. 2 are in the central prison in Kinshasa.
On the negative.
None of the 5 have been charged. 2 are arbitrarily detained.
More negative.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759743 Date: 06/30/2015
We received attached requestâ€¢this week for support to investigate the cases of the 5 officers. While only about
$70,000, the request is strange and worrying. In 4 of the cases an open file in North or South Kivu military prosecutors
office exists. Only in the case of should the Military Prosecutor General need to be involved, given the B6
rank of the suspect.
In all 5 cases the local military prosecutor had opened a legal investigation and had interviewed all the victims.
The cases were stopped by political or financial intervention. Now the request indicates the Military Prosecutor General
needs to fly all over the country to investigate. Not only is the request 18 months late in coming, it makes no sense. In 4
of 5 cases, the military prosecutor in the Province has jurisdiction. They just need to continue their work. With the
suspects all in Kinshasa, it makes their work more difficult.
Is someone trying to make some money? Were they given the impression that the international community is
so interested in this case, but the government is not? Or is there so little trust in the local prosecutors that central
government wants more control? Or do governmental officials know so little about how criminal cases function that
they are inadvertently delaying procedures.
Conclusion. Lobby has been effective to remove from position of active command. Political intervention has not
had desired impact in terms of judicial action.
To be continued.
Have a good weekend.

Subject: Demarche on UNGA redlines
FYI: We will send today for your review and approval a demarche describing the circumstances in which the U.S. would
walk out of speeches at the UN General Assembly and asking countries to join us in the walkout. Note that we are
differing from past practice when we simply did not have anyone in the U.S. seat during speeches by certain countries.
This year an appropriate-level individual will be behind the U.S. placard for all speeches and will remain unless these
redlines are crossed.
This demarche is going out to EU member state capitals, as well as Oslo, Reykjavik, Ottawa, Canberra, Wellington, Tokyo,
Seoul, Buenos Aires, Bogota, San Jose, and Montevideo. USUN asks that our posts deliver the demarche in advance of an
EU political directors meeting on this issue in New York Monday morning our time.
The background portion,of the cable, which discusses EU internal dynamics on this issue, is classified, but the
unclassified talking points will come to you for your review.

I'd like to set up mtg w John Kerry for week after UNGA. Offer him choice if he wants to come to State but make clear I
will come to meet him at his office or other place of his choosing.
Also, how are we doing w Durbin mtg--I owe him one and not sure I can wait for larger Reid/Pelosi mtg.

Subject: UNESCO update
Huma, Joe, Jake,
We are likely to have one candidate against Hosni in round 4 of the UNESCO director general race on Monday.
EU Commissioner Ferraro-Waldner has pulled out formally.
Our UNESCO Amb. Killion reports that candidates Baki (Ecuador) and Bukova (Bulgaria) met Sunday night Paris time.
Baki has given Bukova an ultimatum. Either they form a unity ticket with Ivonne Baki on top or Baki leaves the race.
Tonight former Ferrero-Waldner supporters are considering how to vote. Mexican Dep Secretary for 10 issues called
me. They are wondering whether to support Baki in round 4 now that F-W is out.
I noted that we wanted the strongest of the ladies to stay in (Fyi, they both were on our list of the most qualified
candidates.) Too early a pull out could also affect the race.
The Egyptian candidate could lose because of a consolidation of alternative candidates.
I am sorry to report that the Egyptians have used harsh tactics in the halls of UNESCO. A member of the U.S. delegation
has seen a member of the Egyptian-hired ""public relations"" group walking around with an envelope of cash. They
pushed to have two Amb recalled. Disgust and resentment is running high.
The Egyptians are pushing delegations very hard. FM Aboul-Gheit has stopped in Paris to deal with the UNESCO race
while en route to NY for UNGA.
A/S Feltman writes that Egyptian Ambassador Shoukry has called him twice todaY with a ""message from the Foreign
Minister."" FM Aboul Gheit is angry and reports President Mubarak is angry.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759763 Date: 06/30/2015
A/S Feltman notes"" maybe we've become a convenient excuse."" A/S Feltman very helpfully pushed back and helped
defend our ambassador who had been criticized.
Our strategy relies on our Amb being low-key. He is following his instructions. We should be unhappy with the way he is
being attacked personally. Candidates Bukova and Baki are moving ahead on their own lobbying. FYI, Hosni even said
on French TV that the U.S. is neutral reflecting our especially low key approach this past week. Now that Hosni may
lose, the U.S. looks like a convenient one to blame.
Events will continue to develop among the candidates and voting delegations. The Monday 9am Paris time Europeans'
meeting could indicate Bukova's relative support and offer a chance to reveal any Baki-Bukova deal if there is one.
Meanwhile Egyptian pressure is likely to continue at UNESCO on Monday.
Monday's vote is midday EDT.

Apparently you can't get away from me. We're sharing the FT op-ed page tomorrow. Here's my piece....
Thanks again for Friday. Much favorable comment. Good luck at the UNGA.
President Barack Obama's announcement of a new system for protecting America's allies against Iranian missiles has
ignited charges that he is scaling back the one he inherited from George W. Bush as a concession to the Russians.
In fact, the Obama plan is a big improvement on the Bush one, and it is designed to counter an evolving Iranian threat,
not to mollify Russian anxieties.
Mr Bush's decision to put 10 missile interceptors in Poland and an associated radar in the Czech Republic was based
on a concern that Iran was developing long-range rockets that could hit the US. The Bush system would have been less
effective against shorter-range Iranian missiles, and it would have left much of Europe, notably including America's ally
Turkey, unprotected.
Over the last several years, the Iranians have shifted their efforts from developing a few long-range rockets to
deploying large numbers of shorter-range ones that pose an immediate danger to southeastern Europe and the Middle
East, as well as to US forces stationed there. Unlike Mr Bush's, Mr Obama's plan will quickly field a missile-defence
capability to address an existing threat. It can be upgraded to deal with longer-range Iranian missiles in the future.
The Central Europeans who have reacted to the decision with apprehension or alarm should recognize that the
replacement of a conceptually flawed plan with a more credible one strengthens the bonds of transatlantic defence.
The view from Moscow has been clouded by outright paranoia. Military experts there suspected that the US rockets
in Poland, while advertised as defensive, could be used offensively, even pre-emptively, against Russia. Laying to rest
that far-fetched scenario was not the prime motivation for Mr Obama's decision, nor should it have been. However, by
removing what has been a gratuitous irritant in bilateral relations, the president has improved the prospects for US-
Russian arms control negotiations now underway in Geneva.
Those talks could produce by December a new treaty reducing numbers of strategic â€” that is, intercontinental â€”
weapons. If ratified by the US Senate (which will not be easy, given the ferocity of the partisan wars in Washington), the
US and Russia will be on track for further reductions in the future. Mr Obama and Russian President Dmitri Medvedev,
who are due to meet in New York this week, have jointly called for the eventual goal of eliminating nuclear weapons.
As they and their successors take steps in that direction, they will have to grapple with a stark paradox of the nuclear
age: mutual deterrence depends on each side being vulnerable to retaliation from the other. If either side has enough
defences to trump the other side's offence, the mutuality of deterrence breaks down and one or both sides will be on
hair-trigger, making war more likely in a crisis.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759768 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759768 Date: 06/30/2015
American statesmen pounded this inescapable truth into the heads of their initially sceptical Soviet counterparts 40
years ago. The result was the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty signed by Richard Nixon and Leonid Brezhnev in 1972. By
limiting the defensive capability of both superpowers, the ABM treaty was a necessary companion piece to a series of
treaties setting ceilings on offensive weaponry. Because nuclear weapons were expected to with us forever, the ABM
treaty was meant to last in perpetuity.
While the Soviets were converted to the logic of restricting defence, Ronald Reagan was not. The late US president
championed the development of a space-based comprehensive shield that would make offensive weapons â€” and
therefore mutual deterrence â€”""impotent and obsolete.""
Many experts believed Reagan's vision, which they derisively nicknamed Star Wars, was an impossible dream. So did
his successor, George H. W. Bush, who treated the program with benign neglect while negotiating with the Russians in
the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks (START) begun by Mr Reagan.
The second president Bush reversed his father's policy. He greatly weakened the START process, pulled the US out of
the ABM treaty and sought to revive a national missile defence (NMD) system. His decision to build the interceptor and
radar sites in Poland and the Czech Republic was, as one of his aides told me at the time, in large measure about
""pouring concrete for what will eventually be a global NMD.""
Key officials of the Obama administration â€” including the president himself, who studied arms control in college â€”
understand the linkage between reduction of offences and regulation of defences. However, they have avoided raising
that issue in the context of last week's decision. That is partly because they want their plan to be judged on its own
merits, vis-Ã -vis the Iranian threat. But it is because they have more than enough fights with the Republicans without
further energizing the right wing by trying to reinstate the principles of the ABM treaty.
Yet sooner or later the US administration will have to grasp the nettle of regulating strategic defences. Otherwise,
continued reductions in strategic nuclear offences will be either impossible or, worse, dangerous.
The author is president of the Brookings Institution.

Cheryl,
had a second meeting with Amb. Sussman on Friday, in which the Ambassador told
overqualified for the position he envisions.
According to Amb. Sussman was extremely complimentary of her, stating she was very well-respected across
the board and everyone he spoke with about her had nothing but wonderful things to say. However, he said he'd be
embarrassed/feel bad about asking her to do 85% of the tasks he envisions for this role (Amb. Sussman's job description
for the position is below, so you can see why he'd say this).
said they left things on very good terms with the Ambassador stating he wants them to maintain a relationship
and asked her to get back in touch with him in 6 to 7 weeks. He also made a vague, and somewhat odd, reference to
her possibly volunteering or working on a contract basis down the line at the embassy. In addition, he made a call to
nominate her for a position on the while she was sitting in his office.

does not want Amb. Sussman to think that she is at all unhappy with the way she was treated. He seems to put
a lot of thought and deliberation into this decision given how long he has drawn out this process and how many people
he spoke with about her. agrees that she would probably be overqualified for the position that he envisions,
however, she also feels that he is not using this position to its fullest potential and value.
Right after I got off the phone with the desk officer for London called to ask who the appropriate person was for
Amb Sussman to contact regarding staffing. I said you - so you will likely get an email from the Ambassador about this
shortly.
I would keep her posted on our end.

Subject: Fwd: Daily Star Article about Prime Minister Hasina's Speech
Dear Melanne:
I am drawing your attenrtion to the following report in the leading daily
newspaper in Bangladesh. All other papers carried the same news.
This is a report on the Prime Minister Hasina's speech on the floor
of the parliament. High-lighted section of the report refers to me
without naming name but giving her usual description of me.
See if you can find a way to clear her mind of all the terrifying thoughts
she has about me. I invite you to be a peace-maker! Otherwise it will become
explosive for nothing. PM Hasina is coming to NY for General Assembly
meeting, and will have a meeting with Sec H during her visit.
See you soon.
Yunus
Prime Mnister Hasina Warns
The Daily Star, Dhaka, September 17, 2009
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina yesterday alerted the countrymen to the
ongoing conspiracy of 'special quarter' and 'undemocratic forces' who are
still plotting to wipe out democracy and grab the seat in power after
being failed to capture it.
The prime minister, however, urged the Leader of the Opposition and BNP
Chairperson Khaleda Zia and her allies to return to parliament for raising
their voices.
Recalling her experience as the opposition leader, Hasina said, ""We used
to walk out from parliament sessions, boycott it but we used to return to

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759784 Date: 06/30/2015
the House again.""
Meanwhile, the parliament session was adjourned till 4:00pm on October 4.
Sheikh Hasina, also ruling Awami League (AL) president, urged people to keep vigil against recurrence of incidents like
BDR mutiny to reverse the democratic strides. She also urged the people not to be misguided by any 'false campaign.'
""While running the government and doing development works, we find continued obstacles in every step from the
'special quarter', benefited by undemocratic government, who earlier had captured power through undemocratic
means, So, I urge the countrymen to be cautious so that the democratic trend continues,"" she told the parliament.
The prime minister was speaking at a discussion titled 'democracy and political tolerance' on the occasion of the
International Day of Democracy.
Following an hour long discussion, the House passed a resolution by which Bangladesh will also observe the
International Day of Democracy through holding a discussion in the parliament every year.
Inter-Parliamentary Union decided to observe September 15 of every year as International Day of Democracy in the
context of a resolution adopted by the United Nations in 2007.
The International Day of Democracy was first observed in 2008 but Bangladesh could not observe the day as unelected
caretaker government ruled the country during that time.
Referring to the sugar price, Sheikh Hasina told the House that a big conspiracy is going on regarding sugar price. Price of
sugar is being raised though stock of sugar is available. ""We are investigating the matter and action will be taken against
those who are responsible for it,""
said the Leader of the House.

On plotting of the conspiracy, Sheikh Hasina said people who wanted to sit in power without election are still hatching
conspiracy against her government.
Pointing out the two years of the past caretaker government, Hasina said, ""Various formulas were floated during that
time by those who would lose security money if contest any election.""
She also disclosed in parliament that many proposals were given to her
(Hasina) during that time including offering her the status of a prime minister without participating,in elections, which
she rejected.
Without mentioning any name, the prime minister said, those who wanted to capture power by creating new political
parties are still continuing their activities to capture power.
""Those persons who had failed to float a new political party, exploit
people, get huge interest from poor people and remain in disguise of good
men wearing good dresses are still busy hatching a conspiracy against the
government,"" said Hasina, who was sent to a makeshift jail during the
anti-graft drive of the past caretaker government.
She, however, hailed the caretaker regime for holding a free and fair election, which she claimed as the best election
since 1973.
The AL Chief Hasina told lawmakers that the country has been pushed back economically, socially and culturally by
applying the undemocratic and military rule while only a special quarter became rich but the majority people remained
ignored.

The premier vowed that her government is committed to materialise all its election pledges to fulfil the desire of the
people.
Hasina said her party believes in the definition of democracy given by Abraham Lincoln who said Democracy means--by
the People, of the People, for the People.
""But this democracy has been absent in the country since 1975 when the military ruler grabbed power throwing an
elected government,"" she said.
AL leaders Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim, Suranjit Sengupta, Abdul Latif Siddiqui, Advocate Fazle Rabbi Mia, Abdul Matin
Khasru, Bangladesh Workers' Party President Rashed Khan Menon, among others, took part in the discussion.

I haven't seen the latest draft of the speech but the horn of Africa is currently experiencing a serious crisis â€“ one of its
worst in years. I think we should reference the crisis in the speech and perhaps discuss what we are doing to address â€“

Somalia faces worst food crisis in 18 years: UN
(AFP) â€“ 1 day ago
ROME â€” Drought, conflict and displacement are causing the worst humanitarian crisis in war-torn Somalia in 18 years,
the UN food agency warned on Monday.
Some 3.6 million people, about half the Somali population, need emergency aid including 1.3 million people displaced by
fighting in the Horn of Africa country, the Food and Agriculture Organisation said in a statement.
Around 1.4 million Somali farmers face a severe drought, while some 655,000 poor urban dwellers face high prices for
basic food staples, the FAO said.
Hundreds of thousands of Somalis have fled their homes over the past three years of violence involving hardline Islamist
movements and many more in total over the country's 18 years of almost uninterrupted civil chaos.
Hunger also stalks other countries in east Africa and the Horn of Africa region, the UN agency said.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759795 Date: 06/30/2015
The number of people depending on food aid in the region -- currently nearly 20 million -- ""may increase as the hunger
season progresses, particularly among marginal farmers and low-income urban dwellers,"" the FAO said.
""Below-average rains combined with conflict and displacement are aggravating an already serious food insecurity
situation in the region,"" it said.
An added element is El Nino, a weather phenomenon associated with floods, droughts and other climatic disturbances,
the FAO said.
""The effects of El Nino, which usually brings heavy rains towards the end of the year, could make matters worse, ...
destroying crops both in the field and in stores (and) increasing livestock losses,"" the statement added.
Continued low purchasing power is also threatening food security in the region, the UN agency said.

A Bold New Strategy for Smart Aid
Matthew Bishop is the New York bureau chief for The Economist magazine and, with Michael Green, he is author of the
2008 book, Philanthrocapitalism: How the Rich Can Save the World <http://www.philanthrocapitalism.neth .
The Clinton Global Initiative's fifth birthday celebration this week
<http://www.clintonglobalinitiative.oreourmeetings/meeting_annual.asp?Section=OurMeetings&PageTitle=CGI%20An
nual%20Meeting> may be a less glitzy affair than in previous years but it marks an amazing comeback. Last year the
Obama administration actually thought about having it shut down as a price of Mrs. Clinton becoming Secretary of State
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/16/AR2008111602039.html> , fearful that Bill's
schmoozing of wealthy philanthropists could compromise his wife's role as America's top diplomat. Now, Obama is going
to be topping the bill, outshining the A-list celebrities, heads of state and corporate titans who pack the hall for the
annual ""Philanthropy Oscars.""
Yet the most important speech at the event may not be delivered by either the current or the former president but by
Mrs. Clinton herself. She has said the State Department is going to forge new partnerships with philanthropists to
achieve America's foreign policy goals (and has already started work on a new initiative around the Middle East peace
process). Her speech is an opportunity to announce a radical new departure in the way America gives aid.
The aid business in crisis. The past year may have been tough for the world's richest countries, but it has been far harder
for the poorest. Markets for exports have slumped as rich conumers have reined in their spending. Government
budgets are creaking under the strain of the global recession and foreign aid is threatening to dry up. At the same time,
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759806 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759806 Date: 06/30/2015
the intellectual attack on aid has escalated, led by the author of ""Dead Aid"" <http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-
dyn/content/article/2009/04/02/AR2009040203285.html> , the African economist, Dambisa Moyo.
The CGI has become the showcase for those who believe Moyo is wrong and that aid can be effective. The CGI is not
about the old government-to-government aid model. Its members aim to deliver smart aid, based on partnerships
between business, philanthropists, and social entrepreneurs. Mrs. Clinton's speech is the perfect opportunity to show
that government is ready to work with the CGI crowd to rethink how it does aid.
One promising, for-profit solution to poverty is to take the model of microfinance -- one of the more resilient corners of
banking during the financial crisis -- and extend it to improve education, health care, clean water and sanitation. Loan-
based investments can be more sustainable than traditional aid or charity, because they tap the far larger sums available
in the capital markets and are not dependent on the whims of political leaders or budgetary wrangling. Some in
government may be reluctant to give up their near monopoly on aid but it is long overdue.

A Bold New Strategy for Smart Aid
Matthew Bishop is the New York bureau chief for The Economist magazine and, with Michael Green, he is author of the
2008 book, Philanthrocapitalism: How the Rich Can Save the World <http://www.philanthrocapitalism.neth .
The Clinton Global Initiative's fifth birthday celebration this week
<http://www.clintonglobalinitiative.oreourmeetings/meeting_annual.asp?Section=OurMeetings&PageTitle=CGI%20An
nual%20Meeting> may be a less glitzy affair than in previous years but it marks an amazing comeback. Last year the
Obama administration actually thought about having it shut down as a price of Mrs. Clinton becoming Secretary of State
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/16/AR2008111602039.html> , fearful that Bill's
schmoozing of wealthy philanthropists could compromise his wife's role as America's top diplomat. Now, Obama is going
to be topping the bill, outshining the A-list celebrities, heads of state and corporate titans who pack the hall for the
annual ""Philanthropy Oscars.""
Yet the most important speech at the event may not be delivered by either the current or the former president but by
Mrs. Clinton herself. She has said the State Department is going to forge new partnerships with philanthropists to
achieve America's foreign policy goals (and has already started work on a new initiative around the Middle East peace
process). Her speech is an opportunity to announce a radical new departure in the way America gives aid.
The aid business in crisis. The past year may have been tough for the world's richest countries, but it has been far harder
for the poorest. Markets for exports have slumped as rich consumers have reined in their spending. Government

budgets are creaking under the strain of the global recession and foreign aid is threatening to dry up. At the same time,
the intellectual attack on aid has escalated, led by the author of ""Dead Aid"" <http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-
dyn/content/article/2009/04/02/AR2009040203285.html> , the African economist, Dambisa Moyo.
The CGI has become the showcase for those who believe Moyo is wrong and that aid can be effective. The CGI is not
about the old government-to-government aid model. Its members aim to deliver smart aid, based on partnerships
between business, philanthropists, and social entrepreneurs. Mrs. Clinton's speech is the perfect opportunity to show
that government is ready to work with the CGI crowd to rethink how it does aid.
One promising, for-profit solution to poverty is to take the model of microfinance -- one of the more resilient corners of
banking during the financial crisis -- and extend it to improve education, health care, clean water and sanitation. Loan-
based investments can be more sustainable than traditional aid or charity, because they tap the far larger sums available
in the capital markets and are not dependent on the whims of political leaders or budgetary wrangling. Some in
government may be reluctant to give up their near monopoly on aid but it is long overdue.
A second opportunity is to get the public more involved in the aid business. New giving organizations such as Kiva
<http://www.kiva.org/about/how> have demonstrated how the public can play an effective role in allocating money to
needy people <http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/06/AR2009070603594.html> .

I can't tell if anyone is listening to Obama at un but the lack of clear Afghanistan policy is unwinding the coalition and
threatens to cause a massive deer in headlights problem for administration if not resolved soon.
Happy to give you confidential feedback on cgi speech though it's an easy audience. Good chance to put down the

Dear Cheryl:
We in London are extremely excited for Secretary Clinton's visit. Hopefully if you join her we will have a few minutes to
get together. The purpose of this e-mail is to bring you up to date on my decision regarding the potential employment
of as my Schedule C assistant. I met two times with and the meetings confirmed everything
you said as to her capabilities, intelligence and personality. My conclusion at the end of the meetings was that
was so overqualified for the position we need to fill. It would be like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole and it
would end up not working out for either of us. Our needs are 80% administrative, evidenced by our position description
which is attached.
I believe that understood my difficulties in attempting to have a Special Assistant with her skills. That being said,
I definitely want to use her capabilities and create a relationship not only personally, but with the Embassy in the future.
I have appointed her to which she was very excited about. I am in the process of
looking for special projects in the Embassy and to make introductions to major corporations who may be able to use her
skills in the private sector. I am attaching her e-mail to me, which speaks for itself.

For Secretary Clinton
Dear Hillary,
You will remember our initiative to bring the most senior retired generals from the Chinese and US militaries. With
these 10 generals from the two countires, I am going to be in DC on October 21 and 22. these Generals have been part
our of our Sanya Initiative - the unofficial mil-mil dialogue I started last year. It'll be me, Joe Prueher, Charley Wilhelm,
Ron Fogleman, and Denny Reimer. The Chinese will be led by General Xiong Guangkai and include four other very senior
and respected Generals from the PLA.
The Chinese view this as a formal track one program and take it very seriously. We will meet with ADM Mullen and ADM
Keating in Honolulu and see GEN Cartwright at the Pentagon. It would be a terrific sign of the U.S.'s support for this
relationship if you were able join or host (I'd be pleased to fund) a very private dinner on the evening of the 21 or the
22nd of October. Just you, the Generals, and interpreters - perhaps the Chinese Ambassador if you think that would be
valuable.
I met with Kurt Campbell last month, and we will meet with him and Jim Steinberg. He expressed strong support for this
dialogue as well as the economic one we started in Beijing last August. You know we would welcome involvement from
State at any of our projects - our goal is to make a small but meaningful difference in the relationship.
Warm best wishes, (I'm cheering for you!)

Secretary Clinton,
Just wanted to make sure that you saw the news about one of China's oil conglomerates and the Iranian National Oil
Company over the
weekend:
Iran, China sign a major oilfield deal, Mon, 28 Sep 2009 15:05:09 GMT China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) has signed
a contract with National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) for the development of Iran's South Azadegan oilfield. The Chinese
company will buy a 70 percent share of the whole project, according to an agreement signed Sunday in Lausanne,
Switzerland between CNPC and NIOC's overseas investment subsidiary, Naftiran Intertrade Company (NICO) that covers
a 90 percent stake in the project.
A likely explanation would be that this deal has been long in the making. Still, Tehran's motivation for releasing this
information in English at this time is worth considering.
The whole story from an English-language Iranian outlet is pasted in below, and I found three Chinese-language sources
with corroborating reports (nothing in English from China, though):

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05759850 Date: 06/30/2015
CNPC, which won a bid in January to develop the North Azadegan oilfield, now holds a 70 percent share of the project
with NICO holding 20 percent, and lnpex of Japan having the remaining 10 percent.
The South Azadegan project is slated to produce 260,000 barrels of crude oil per day, and its development will cost
around $2.5 billion.
The field, along the Iraqi border, holds reserves estimated at approximately 42 billion barrels of oil, one of the world's
largest finds in the last 30 years.
Iran provides 14 percent of China's demand for oil.
The deal is couched in buy-back terms, in which CNPC will hand over the operation of the field to NIOC after
development and will receive payments from the oil production for a few years to cover its investment.
China's investment in Iran's energy sector has increased as some western countries, led by the US, have sanctioned Iran
over its peaceful nuclear program.

Hi Burns,
I received the email below from Lyn Lusi, a highly trained and experienced program administrator with HEAL Africa
(Congo). I tried to line her up to be a speaker at the Global Summit that Hillary attended, but we were unable to book
her due to scheduling issues. She's not some random, run-of-the-mill aid worker; she's really, really special, having set
up the fistula hospital and teaching hospital in Goma with her husband, Dr. Jo Lusi. Lyn sent me this email and requested
I ""do what I can"" to encourage Hillary to empower the indigenous physicians and trained personnel in this hospital
rather than bring in outside partners to start something new.
Blessings to you,

Conversation: Suggested letter for follow up to Mrs Clinton's visit to HEAL Africa
Subject: Suggested letter for follow up to Mrs Clinton's visit to HEAL Africa
This is Lyn Lusi writing to you from HEAL Africa in Goma and your address comes from the business card you left me
when you visited us. You may have heard that Secretary of State Mrs Clinton and Ambassador Ms Verveer came to
HEAL Africa on Tuesday 11th August. The visit went very well, and the organisation was impeccable, so she could
achieve her objectives. While in our Conference Centre, she announced a package of aid to Congo to fight Gender Based
Violence.
First she congratulated HEAL Africa on the excellent work we are doing; then she announced a deal between the US and
the Norwegian Government to build a state of the art fistula and teaching hospital in Goma.
She must have been aware of the shock and discouragement of all our staff. In effect she was saying:
""Your excellent work is not really excellent at all, and we will work with the Norwegians to replace you in North Kivu.""
I seriously believe she was not properly briefed, because of some remarks she made as she was leaving.
This is now a request to you, and if possible, other members of the your organisation, if you would be so kind as to
contact them. Nothing is set in stone, and politicians respond to pressure from their friends and constituencies. We
believe that wise use of funds means building capacity among local organisations that have already proved that they can
do the work, and sustain their efforts, rather than starting something new.
I am attaching below a letter like the one we have written to Mrs Clinton and a similar one to Ambassador Verveer. If
you think it is appropriate, we are requesting you to write a similar letter to both of them. We are hoping that local
Congolese organisations will not be excluded from these resources to build local capacity on the foundations of what is
being done already.
With kind regards.

Goma, 11th August 2009
Dear Mrs Clinton,
If We ..... followed with interest reports of your visit to Goma on 11th August 2009, where you convened a meeting of
Congolese actors in the fight against Gender Based Violence at HEAL Africa training center. The commitment of the
people of the United States to working alongside Congolese associations for peace and human rights is heartening, after
16 years of endless war.
We congratulate you for this pioneering visit which gave a voice to Congolese community based organizations, who are
often overpowered by international actors. We sincerely hope that the US government and USAID will take the next step
in working alongside community based organizations in Eastern Congo.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760030 Date: 06/30/2015
After studying the announcement of the package of assistance that is being prepared to contribute to fighting Gender
Based Violence in the east of Congo, we are mystified to hear that the United States and the Norwegian government
have decided to build for North Kivu a centre of excellence for training doctors in fistula repair and care of mothers.
According to good development principles, outside assistance builds on what is already in place and functioning well,
developing proven capacity and giving local actors the additional tools they need to do a better job.
As friends and supporters of HEAL Africa for many years, we know that this hospital has pioneered fistula repair in North
Kivu and Maniema provinces since 2002, when no one else was interested in caring for women with fistula. They have
four experienced surgeons trained in Addis Ababa fistula hospital, and have performed over 1600 fistula surgeries. HEAL
Africa has a wide network of community based workers to identify and support patients coming and returning. HEAL
Africa's surgical teams perform outreach surgery in North Kivu and Maniema provinces in local general hospitals, linked
at the same time with in-service training of local staff, and referring only the most complicated cases to Goma. These
services are recognized by reputable agencies since the United States through IRC, through UNICEF and through
Engenderhealth, has invested in HEAL Africa staff, equipment and infrastructure over the past five year. The Spanish
Embassy has supported HEAL Africa's prevention of fistula initiatives over the past four years, through their wide-
reaching Safe Motherhood program, working through local associations of mothers-to-be for maternity insurance and
access to safe deliveries.
HEAL Africa has a clearly defined place within the government medical system of North Kivu where they are recognized
as the tertiary referral hospital of the province. Thus they are a recognized clinical training centre of the Medical Faculty
of the University of Goma, offering the first two years of accredited clinical specialization in Pediatrics, Obstetrics and
Gynecology, Family Medicine, Surgery and Orthopedics.
HEAL Africa is a Congolese not for profit association which has completely rebuilt itself after total destruction by the
volcano, with assistance from many friends in USA and around the world. They have a state of the art surgical suite, but
the buildings hastily erected in the aftermath of the volcano are inappropriate for the quality of care they wish to offer
to patients: they deserve better.
We wish to request that the State Department give assistance to HEAL Africa to increase the quality of their services and
training capacity through the newly announced package of financial aid. We would like to ask you to fund the
construction of the three storey building which is the final stage of reconstruction of the hospital after the catastrophe
of the volcano in January 2002. The second floor of this building will be entirely devoted to women's fistula services;
and the whole hospital is devoted to teaching and preparing Congolese doctors to give excellent service in the most
underserved areas of Congo.
Many visitors from the US Embassy in Kinshasa, from USAID in Washington and Nairobi, the Secretary General of the
United Nations Mr Ban Ki Moon, Ms Rice from the Security Council, US senators and deputies, and a great number of
aides from your government have visited HEAL Africa and have come away enchanted by a hospital of excellence run
entirely by Congolese staff of the highest caliber. They are hoping that, through your visit, you will be able to advocate

BEGIN TEXT
Questions have been raised regarding remarks by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on September 30 before the United
Nations Security Council on the adoption of a resolution to combat sexual violence in armed conflict. In her statement,
she said that we have seen rape used as a tactic before in a number of countries, including Sri Lanka.
Regarding the Secretary's reference to Sri Lanka in her address, we want to be clear. Over the course of the difficult
conflict between the government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), stretching into this
decade, the State Department as well as credible human rights organizations reported numerous cases of rape and
sexual violence in Sri Lanka, particularly acts committed against women held in detention by the government. This was
the basis for the Secretary's statement. At the same time, in the most recent phase of the conflict, from 2006 to 2009,
though we remained deeply concerned about reports of extrajudicial killings, disappearances and mistreatment of
detainees, we have not received reports that rape and sexual abuse were used as tools of war, as they clearly have in
other conflict areas around the world. We hope that this clarification puts the issue in its proper context.
These questions should not detract from the specific actions that Sri Lanka needs to take now. With the end of the
military conflict, Secretary Clinton believes strongly that Sri Lanka must focus to the future and move forward on the
promotion of peace and the protection of human rights. The government of Sri Lanka should release more than 250,000
displaced persons who are still confined in camps, and lead a process of genuine political and social reconciliation. The
United States stands ready to assist and support the people of Sri Lanka with these critical challenges.

Hi Burns,
I received the email below from Lyn Lusi, a highly trained and experienced program administrator with HEAL Africa
(Congo). I tried to line her up to be a speaker at the Global Summit that Hillary attended, but we were unable to book
her due to scheduling issues. She's not some random, run-of-the-mill aid worker; she's really, really special, having set
up the fistula hospital and teaching hospital in Goma with her husband, Dr. Jo Lusi. Lyn sent me this email and requested
I ""do what I can"" to encourage Hillary to empower the indigenous physicians and trained personnel in this hospital
rather than bring in outside partners to start something new.
Blessings to you,
Kay

Conversation: Suggested letter for follow up to Mrs Clinton's visit to HEAL Africa
Subject: Suggested letter for follow up to Mrs Clinton's visit to HEAL Africa
This is Lyn Lusi writing to you from HEAL Africa in Goma and your address comes from the business card you left me
when you visited us. You may have heard that Secretary of State Mrs Clinton and Ambassador Ms Verveer came to
HEAL Africa on Tuesday 11th August. The visit went very well, and the organisation was impeccable, so she could
achieve her objectives. While in our Conference Centre, she announced a package of aid to Congo to fight Gender Based
Violence.
First she congratulated HEAL Africa on the excellent work we are doing; then she announced a deal between the US and
the Norwegian Government to build a state of the art fistula and teaching hospital in Goma.
She must have been aware of the shock and discouragement of all our staff. In effect she was saying:
""Your excellent work is not really excellent at all, and we will work with the Norwegians to replace you in North Kivu.""
I seriously believe she was not properly briefed, because of some remarks she made as she was leaving.
This is now a request to you, and if possible, other members of the your organisation, if you would be so kind as to
contact them. Nothing is set in stone, and politicians respond to pressure from their friends and constituencies. We
believe that wise use of funds means building capacity among local organisations that have already proved that they can
do the work, and sustain their efforts, rather than starting something new.
I am attaching below a letter like the one we have written to Mrs Clinton and a similar one to Ambassador Verveer. If
you think it is appropriate, we are requesting you to write a similar letter to both of them. We are hoping that local
Congolese organisations will not be excluded from these resources to build local capacity on the foundations of what is
being done already.
With kind regards.

Secretary of State Mrs Hillary Clinton

Washington, DC 20520
Goma, 11th August 2009
Dear Mrs Clinton,
I/ We followed with interest reports of your visit to Goma on 11th August 2009, where you convened a meeting of
Congolese actors in the fight against Gender Based Violence at HEAL Africa training center. The commitment of the
people of the United States to working alongside Congolese associations for peace and human rights is heartening, after
16 years of endless war.
We congratulate you for this pioneering visit which gave a voice to Congolese community based organizations, who are
often overpowered by international actors. We sincerely hope that the US government and USAID will take the next step
in working alongside community based organizations in Eastern Congo.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760036 Date: 06/30/2015
After studying the announcement of the package of assistance that is being prepared to contribute to fighting Gender
Based Violence in the east of Congo, we are mystified to hear that the United States and the Norwegian government
have decided to build for North Kivu a centre of excellence for training doctors in fistula repair and care of mothers.
According to good development principles, outside assistance builds on what is already in place and functioning well,
developing proven capacity and giving local actors the additional tools they need to do a better job.
As friends and supporters of HEAL Africa for many years, we know that this hospital has pioneered fistula repair in North
Kivu and Maniema provinces since 2002, when no one else was interested in caring for women with fistula. They have
four experienced surgeons trained in Addis Ababa fistula hospital, and have performed over 1600 fistula surgeries. HEAL
Africa has a wide network of community based workers to identify and support patients coming and returning. HEAL
Africa's surgical teams perform outreach surgery in North Kivu and Maniema provinces in local general hospitals, linked
at the same time with in-service training of local staff, and referring only the most complicated cases to Goma. These
services are recognized by reputable agencies since the United States through IRC, through UNICEF and through
Engenderhealth, has invested in HEAL Africa staff, equipment and infrastructure over the past five year. The Spanish
Embassy has supported HEAL Africa's prevention of fistula initiatives over the past four years, through their wide-
reaching Safe Motherhood program, working through local associations of mothers-to-be for maternity insurance and
access to safe deliveries.
HEAL Africa has a clearly defined place within the government medical system of North Kivu where they are recognized
as the tertiary referral hospital of the province. Thus they are a recognized clinical training centre of the Medical Faculty
of the University of Goma, offering the first two years of accredited clinical specialization in Pediatrics, Obstetrics and
Gynecology, Family Medicine, Surgery and Orthopedics.
HEAL Africa is a Congolese not for profit association which has completely rebuilt itself after total destruction by the
volcano, with assistance from many friends in USA and around the world. They have a state of the art surgical suite, but
the buildings hastily erected in the aftermath of the volcano are inappropriate for the quality of care they wish to offer
to patients: they deserve better.
We wish to request that the State Department give assistance to HEAL Africa to increase the quality of their services and

construction of the three storey building which is the final stage of reconstruction of the hospital after the catastrophe

U.N. asks Afghanistan to lift election media ban
KABUL, Aug 19 (Reuters) - The United Nations has asked Afghanistan to lift a last-minute ban on media reporting of
violence during Thursday's presidential election, saying the Afghan constitution guaranteed a free press. Afghan
authorities imposed the ban on Tuesday with two decrees, the first barring journalists from reporting any violence in the
country between 6:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. (0130-1530 GMT) on polling day. The second ordered journalists to stay away
from the scenes of any attacks. The government says the measures are intended to prevent reports of violence from
scaring Afghans away from voting. Taliban fighters have vowed to disrupt the election.â€¢ The United Nations said Afghans
had a right to information, and restricting the media could undermine confidence in the poll. ""People need access to
information, not only on polling day but after polling day. The credibility of these elections is directly linked to the
information that they have access to,"" said Aleem Siddique, spokesman for the U.N. mission in Kabul. ""Its unclear to us
what if any legal basis there would be for such a directive when Afghanistan's constitution guarantees freedom of
expression and freedom of the press. We are making this point to the Afghan authorities,"" he said on Wednesday.
Afghan police have taken a more aggressive attitude towards reporters in recent days. Several journalists were beaten
by police at the scene of a suicide car bombing on Tuesday and a siege with gunmen on Wednesday.

The Secretary's Call Sheet for
Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari
Purpose of Call: To express your condolences regarding the deaths of Iraqi MFA personnel in the August 19 attack on
the Iraqi Foreign Ministry.
want to personally express my heartfelt condolences to you for the savage attack on the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign
Affairs today and for the tragic loss of so many Iraqi lives around Baghdad and particularly at the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs.
El I remember fondly our meeting at the MFA in April â€” I was proud to be the first senior U.S. official to attend a meeting
there, and I was deeply saddened to hear that your Ministry was attacked.
CI This is a trying day for Iraqis and the Government of Iraq, but brutal attacks like these only deepen the need for
dedicated Iraqi like you and those in your Ministry, to remain committed to the new Iraq.
0 Know that the United States will continue to stand by Iraq as it faces these challenges.
Background: On Wednesday, August 19, what appears to be a series of VBIED and additional rocket attacks in Baghdad
resulted in the bloodiest day in Baghdad since the June 30 withdrawal of U.S. forces from urban areas. Although exact
numbers have not been confirmed, media is reporting that approximately 75 people were killed across Baghdad with
over 100 injuries. The most devastating attack appears to have been against the Iraqi MFA, where a VBIED was
exploded in front of the main gate. Zebari's Chief of Staff estimated that there were 35-40 fatalities and up to 40
injuries resulting from this attack, with 70% of the building damaged. In April, you were the first senior U.S. official to
hold a meeting at the MFA. Deputy Foreign Minister Labid Abbawi, who attended your meeting at the MFA and who's
wife led your meeting with Iraqi war widows, was reportedly slightly injured and quite shaken by the attack. He may
have lost a number of staff members. At this point, we do not know if other senior-ranking MFA officials were killed or
wounded in the attack.

I received the email below from Lyn Lusi, a highly trained and experienced program administrator with HEAL Africa
(Congo). I tried to line her up to be a speaker at the Global Summit that Hillary attended, but we were unable to book
her due to scheduling issues. She's not some random, run-of-the-mill aid worker; she's really, really special, having set
up the fistula hospital and teaching hospital in Goma with her husband, Dr. Jo Lusi. Lyn sent me this email and requested
I ""do what I can"" to encourage Hillary to empower the indigenous physicians and trained personnel in this hospital
rather than bring in outside partners to start something new.
Blessings to you,

Conversation: Suggested letter for follow up to Mrs Clinton's visit to HEAL Africa
Subject: Suggested letter for follow up to Mrs Clinton's visit to HEAL Africa
This is Lyn Lusi writing to you from HEAL Africa in Goma and your address comes from the business card you left me
when you visited us. You may have heard that Secretary of State Mrs Clinton and Ambassador Ms Verveer came to
HEAL Africa on Tuesday 11th August. The visit went very well, and the organisation was impeccable, so she could
achieve her objectives. While in our Conference Centre, she announced a package of aid to Congo to fight Gender Based
Violence.
First she congratulated HEAL Africa on the excellent work we are doing; then she announced a deal between the US and
the Norwegian Government to build a state of the art fistula and teaching hospital in Goma.
She must have been aware of the shock and discouragement of all our staff. In effect she was saying:
""Your excellent work is not really excellent at all, and we will work with the Norwegians to replace you in North Kivu.""
I seriously believe she was not properly briefed, because of some remarks she made as she was leaving.
This is now a request to you, and if possible, other members of the your organisation, if you would be so kind as to
contact them. Nothing is set in stone, and politicians respond to pressure from their friends and constituencies. We
believe that wise use of funds means building capacity among local organisations that have already proved that they can
do the work, and sustain their efforts, rather than starting something new.

you think it is appropriate, we are requesting you to write a similar letter to both of them. We are hoping that local
Congolese organisations will not be excluded from these resources to build local capacity on the foundations of what is
being done already.
With kind regards.

Dear Mrs Clinton,
I/ We ...... followed with interest reports of your visit to Goma on 11th August 2009, where you convened a meeting of
Congolese actors in the fight against Gender Based Violence at HEAL Africa training center. The commitment of the
people of the United States to working alongside Congolese associations for peace and human rights is heartening, after
16 years of endless war.
We congratulate you for this pioneering visit which gave a voice to Congolese community based organizations, who are
often overpowered by international actors. We sincerely hope that the US government and USAID will take the next step
in working alongside community based organizations in Eastern Congo.
After studying the announcement of the package of assistance that is being prepared to contribute to fighting Gender
Based Violence in the east of Congo, we are mystified to hear that the United States and the Norwegian government
have decided to build for North Kivu a centre of excellence for training doctors in fistula repair and care of mothers.
According to good development principles, outside assistance builds on what is already in place and functioning well,
developing proven capacity and giving local actors the additional tools they need to do a better job.
As friends and supporters of HEAL Africa for many years, we know that this hospital has pioneered fistula repair in North
Kivu and Maniema provinces since 2002, when no one else was interested in caring for women with fistula. They have
four experienced surgeons trained in Addis Ababa fistula hospital, and have performed over 1600 fistula surgeries. HEAL
Africa has a wide network of community based workers to identify and support patients coming and returning. HEAL
Africa's surgical teams perform outreach surgery in North Kivu and Maniema provinces in local general hospitals, linked
at the same time with in-service training of local staff, and referring only the most complicated cases to Goma. These
services are recognized by reputable agencies since the United States through IRC, through UNICEF and through
Engenderhealth, has invested in HEAL Africa staff, equipment and infrastructure over the past five year. The Spanish
Embassy has supported HEAL Africa's prevention of fistula initiatives over the past four years, through their wide-
reaching Safe Motherhood program, working through local associations of mothers-to-be for maternity insurance and
access to safe deliveries.
HEAL Africa has a clearly defined place within the government medical system of North Kivu where they are recognized
as the tertiary referral hospital of the province. Thus they are a recognized clinical training centre of the Medical Faculty
of the University of Goma, offering the first two years of accredited clinical specialization in Pediatrics, Obstetrics and
Gynecology, Family Medicine, Surgery and Orthopedics.

HEAL Africa is a Congolese not for profit association which has completely rebuilt itself after total destruction by the
volcano, with assistance from many friends in USA and around the world. They have a state of the art surgical suite, but
the buildings hastily erected in the aftermath of the volcano are inappropriate for the quality of care they wish to offer
to patients: they deserve better.
We wish to request that the State Department give assistance to HEAL Africa to increase the quality of their services and
training capacity through the newly announced package of financial aid. We would like to ask you to fund the
construction of the three storey building which is the final stage of reconstruction of the hospital after the catastrophe
of the volcano in January 2002. The second floor of this building will be entirely devoted to women's fistula services;
and the whole hospital is devoted to teaching and preparing Congolese doctors to give excellent service in the most
underserved areas of Congo.
Many visitors from the US Embassy in Kinshasa, from USAID in Washington and Nairobi, the Secretary General of the
United Nations Mr Ban Ki Moon, Ms Rice from the Security Council, US senators and deputies, and a great number of
aides from your government have visited HEAL Africa and have come away enchanted by a hospital of excellence run
entirely by Congolese staff of the highest caliber. They are hoping that, through your visit, you will be able to advocate
for the physical plant that will enable them to serve their patients even better than before, and train the next generation
of doctors in an environment where it is possible to practice excellent medicine.
We remain, respectfully,
Yours sincerely,

HRC:
Attached is the draft memo in its current state from the Holbrooke team (it does not yet include RCN's hand edits which
he just sent in).
As you will see, the beginning of this memo lays out 4 strategic interests, 3 of which overlap with the goals we discussed
in our conversation; the fourth goes to the international consequences of success or failure.
Assuming we go with the approach we discussed, a cover memo should work reasonably well with this document
(excepting the discussion on the foreign aid piece). See if you agree.
To actually see the document in its current form with showing edits â€” you need to print the attached version.
Below is the version that accepts all the proposed edits and eliminates the comments so you can read on BB if you
choose.

HRC: I wasn't satisfied by my answer to your question about how to gain leverage over the Pakistanis to move them to
more aggressively pursue AQ. I've thought about it some more and, while I have no silver bullet, here are some further
thoughts.
-- My impression is that the Pakistanis have been more cooperative lately in assisting us target some AQ in Pakistan and
that, where they hold back, it is less a function of affinity toward AQ and more about with whom AQ is imbedded..
-- In particular, they seem to be more reluctant to target AQ where it is nestled with groups they want to cultivate in the
event we ""leave"" Afghanistan and they need influence there. They have seen that before and will hedge their bets.
-- So the first point is that we have to address the reason why they are holding back. If we can disabuse them of the
perception that we are leaving Afghanistan, it will be easier to get the Pakistanis to go after AQ in sanctuaries provided
by groups which would be part of a future Afghanistan dominated by the Taliban.
-- Second, I believe that coercive measures are more likely to be effective if they are targeted against military leaders
who give support to AQ and its allies. Assuming we have adequate intelligence, we can go after bank accounts, travel
and other reachable assets of individual Pakistani officers, raising the stakes for those supporting the militants without
creating an inordinate backlash. Blunter measures of coercion, like conditioning our assistance, are more likely to be
counterproductive. Given the level of distrust for us among the Pakistani people, they would see this as another sharp
swing of the U.S. pendulum which would harden their attitudes and make greater cooperation very difficult for the
Pakistani people to accept.
-- There may be greater leverage in giving the Pakistanis incentives to be more aggressive. Of course, the military's
calculation is most important. I'm not sure what is on their shopping list these days but we would need to balance what
would move the needle on AQ against undercutting our effort to get them to shift their strategic focus away from India..
At the same time, we can be as forward leaning as possible in support of their counterinsurgency capabilities
(equipment, training, whatever material, intelligence and other assistance we can give them if they move into
Wazeristan -- including relief for displaced persons). If they finally take that step, we can do all that is possible to
demonstrate that our arrows are aligned with theirs..
-- On the civilian side, their desire for greater control over how Kerry-Lugar money can be used can be played to our
strategic advantage. If we give them a greater sense that they are directing the use of these funds -- without greatly
undercutting their effectiveness -- it strengthens our position to press them on AQ.
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760082 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760082 Date: 06/30/2015
-- Finally, there is the defining relationship with India. Are there measures that the Indians could take that would reduce
Pakistani anxieties about the Indian front and thus better enable them to focus on threats to the East, including both AQ
and anti-Indian militant groups like LET? Are there confidence building measures such as information sharing on troop
movements that would both reduce uncertainty and support a Pakistani public narrative for a shift in emphasis from
India to the militancy? To the extent India seeks to have Pakistan move more vigorously against the militants, they could
see such steps as advancing their interests. This is tricky territory but may be worth pursuing.

I'm at a gathering In Italy on Beijing's unfinished agenda with many of your friends -- a group as diverse as Yunus and
Tina Brown. You have gotten so many plaudits for your honest engagement in Pakistan.
I'm sure it brings back many memories to be in Marrekesh. The women in Morocco have achieved a great deal,
especially with the family code reform -- and they have had the support of the King. The gender initiative idea that is
part of the FFF is still unformed. I think if you say positive things about its potential, it could make a difference for how it
goes forward and we can help.

Forum for the Future
RELEASE IN FULL
The Forum for the Future is a joint initiative of the countries of the Broader Middle
East and North Africa region (BMENA) and the industrialized countries of the
Group of Eight (G8). It is a unique partnership between governments of the
region, the G8, civil society representatives and private sector leaders to discuss
and exchange ideas on how to best work together to support progress and expand
opportunities for the people of the region.
The Forum for the Future was launched at the Sea Island G8 Summit in the United
States in June, 2004. During this summit, the G8 countries stressed their
commitment to promote progress in the BMENA region and to help establish an
environment conducive to an informal, flexible, open and inclusive dialogue. The
first Forum for the Future was held in Rabat in December 2004, co-hosted by The
Kingdom of Morocco and the United States.
In preparation for the 2009 ministerial, co-chairs Morocco and Italy along with
civil society partners convened three preparatory workshops across the region on:
economic reform (September 26-27, Beirut, Lebanon, in partnership with the
Organization for Civil Activities), political reform (October 5-6, Rabat, Morocco,
in partnership with the Moroccan Organization for Human Rights), and human
development (October 12-13, Doha, Qatar, in partnership with the National Human
Rights Committee and the Arab Democracy Foundation).
The BMENA Initiative complements the objectives outlined by President Obama
in his Cairo speech and is a natural partner for making progress in key areas â€”
notably economic opportunity, education, good governance, human rights, and
women's empowerment. BMENA's emphasis on cooperation among
governments, civil society and the private sector aligns with the President's vision
of partnership between the United States and countries in the region. The United
States will engage with leaders from the region on issues of common interest and
shared values, working together to infuse new energy into the partnership. In
particular, we believe our focus should be firmly on developing a path to
increasing opportunity for the youth of the region.
The Broader Middle East and North Africa participants include Afghanistan,
Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman,
Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, West Bank
and Gaza, and Yemen.
The G8 countries include Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the
United Kingdom, and the United States.

Broader Middle East and North Africa
Democracy Assistance Dialogue
While many initiatives launched under the G8-Broader Middle East and North
Africa (BMENA) umbrella continue to make advances, the most striking progress
is in the Democracy Assistance Dialogue (DAD), which brings together NGOs and
governments in an ongoing basis to advance democratic reform in the region.
Representing a network of hundreds of BMENA NGOs and government
representatives, and with multilateral support, the DAD is now focused on in-
country activities that will implement reform recommendations from the Forum
deliberations. To date, the DAD has convened activities in Morocco, Algeria,
Jordan, Turkey, Yemen, and Italy. The DAD represents a series of thematic
meetings, activities and research characterized by consultation and partnership
between governments and civil society. The DAD's three areas of focus are
women's empowerment, political pluralism, and freedom of expression.
The DAD partners developed ""A Partnership between G8, BMENA Governments
and Civil Society."" This Partnership Document reflects the contributions of many
BMENA governments and civil society leaders alike and outlines a framework of
universal, democratic principles to strengthen the relationship and partnership
between governments and civil society in the region. This document was
acknowledged by government and civil society representatives at the 2008 Abu
Dhabi Forum and is a product of based on substantive discussions and
deliberations between civil society and governments that began nearly two years
ago.
Since its inception more than five years ago, the DAD has facilitated effective and
successful relationships between willing governments, NGOs, the media, political
leaders and civil society experts in the region, and has created a collaborative and
transparent environment in which to accomplish this partnership. DAD partners'
work on in-country programs, including women's empowerment in Algeria, Jordan
and Pakistan, and as well programs in Morocco and Yemen that are focused on
freedom of expression, political party and electoral reform, are notable.

1P 23: BACKGROUND ON FORUM FOR THE FUTURE
From an idea of partnership to a growing reality, the Broader Middle East
and North Africa (BMENA) Initiative represents genuine cooperation
between the G8 and European nations and the governments, business, and
civil society of the region to expand opportunities and prosperity for all.
e The leaders of the G8 industrialized nations and BMENA countries
launched the Partnership for Progress and a Common Future a blueprint
for how G8 and Middle Eastern countries could best work together to
support indigenous calls for reform â€” at the 08 Sea Island, Georgia,
summit in June 2004.
O The centerpiece of BMENA is the Forum for the Future, an annual
gathering of 08, European, and BMENA Foreign Ministers with civil
society to discuss and advance the reform agenda.
O The Forum for the Future provides a unique venue for BMENA civil
society organizations to meet with their government ministers as equal
participants. The Forum fosters constructive government-civil society
interaction to solve complex political, economic, and social problems of
participating countries.
O This year's Forum will include approximately 40 civil society
representatives who participate directly alongside governments. Civil
society participation in the Forum has risen considerably every year since
the first Forum in Morocco in 2004, when only five leaders participated.
e Foreign ministers from across the BMENA region, the 08, and other
partner countries now work with these organizations to further progress
and development in the areas of good governance, civil society,
economic prosperity, and education.
e This year, civil society organizations coordinated three preparatory
meetings involving governments of the region with a cross-section of
civil society leaders to outline priorities and develop recommendations
for the Forum ministerial.

SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED
The Secretary's Participation in the Forum for the Future
Tuesday, November 3, 2009
CONTEXT
You will participate in the Sixth Annual Forum for the Future and deliver a speech
that will highlight the importance of partnership within and across societies to
address common issues and elaborate on the steps the United States has taken to
enact the President's Cairo vision. This year's co-chairs, Italy and Morocco, and
civil-society groups selected political, economic, and social themes for discussion,
the latter of which includes issues such as education and the empowerment of
women. Your participation in the Forum shows continued U.S. support for
indigenous efforts of reform and development, and reinforces the importance
the U.S. attaches to greater cooperation between Broader Middle East and
North Africa (BMENA) governments and civil-society organizations in the
region.
KEY OBJECTIVES/ANNOTATED AGENDA:
I. Opening Session
The Forum's co-chairs, Moroccan Foreign Minister Fassi Fihri and Italian
Foreign Minister Frattini, will deliver opening remarks. You will then deliver
remarks for approximately 15-20 minutes.
Theme 1 â€” Political Reform / Local Governance and Democracy
The key to advancing and sustaining progress is action on the local level; civil
society groups and governments must develop effective working relationships
to benefit their citizens. While expanding the role of civil society is a long-term
effort between the citizens of the BMENA countries and their governments, we see
progress in some areas, including increased women's political participation, such
as in Morocco and Kuwait. The region's civil society continues to work toward
broadening the space for citizens to participate actively in public affairs,
particularly at the local level. Regrettably, some governments in the region have
sought to curtail the essential freedoms of expression and association. The United
States supports opening the political space for civil society to contribute ideas and
priorities to government policy-makers in shaping the future of the BMENA
countries.

HI. Theme 2 â€” Economic Reform / The Impact of the Financial Crisis on the
Economics of the BMENA Region
Sustainable progress requires opening spaces for innovation and creativity,
particularly for young people and women. Expanding opportunities for
entrepreneurs is key to addressing job creation, supporting economic development,
and furthering civic engagement. By assisting the growth of small and medium
enterprises (SMEs) through easing business regulations, enhancing transparency
and accountability, and improving access to financing, countries foster economic
growth and give society new sources of resilience. Additionally, educational
systems need to be responsive to labor-market needs. The United States supports
employment-focused approaches to education, as well as engagement with the
private sector to tackle comprehensively the obstacles that hinder economic growth
and development in the region.
IV. Theme Sâ€” Social Development: A New Perspective on Human Security
The United States supports sustainable development in all sectors of society.
Women's empowerment â€” political, economic, social, and cultural â€” is a
prerequisite for progress. Women across the region have been breaking silence
around many controversial issues, from breast cancer to domestic violence. We
applaud these efforts and will continue to support women who are working to raise
the levels of education, health, rights, and opportunity in their countries.
V. Closing Session
Concluding remarks will be delivered by the 2009 civil-society co-partners,
the Moroccan Organization for Human Rights and Italy's No Peace Without
Justice. Canada, as the next G8 president and Forum co-host in 2010, and the next
BMENA co-host will discuss plans and priorities for the 2010 Forum. After
Foreign Minister Frattini's closing remarks, Foreign Minister Fassi-Fihri will
present the Chair's Summary. The summary is traditionally drafted by the regional
co-chair and is not subject to negotiations, to avoid being bogged down in conflict.

Subject: Strategic Communications for Pakistan
Hello Madame Secretary. I hope you have a productive trip to Pakistan. I wanted to let you know that Ambassador
Haqqani asked me to submit a proposal to help the Government of Pakistan strengthen its communications with the
Pakistani public.
You may recall that my firm did similar hands-on work in Lebanon. The idea is to enhance the Government's internal
capacity to raise public awareness of its accomplishments, build support for its policies, and demonstrate the benefits of
democratic governance.
With stronger communications, they'd obviously be in a better position to convey the benefits of the US-Pakistan
relationship. We've followed Pakistani media coverage of Kerry-Lugar -- with more strategic communications
management by the Government, that could have been a positive story.
(The anti-American forces have used the same messages to attack US aid packages for at least 10 years. It was easy to
see the attacks coming.)
Communications help won't solve the immediate political crisis, but it could be one useful element of a larger strategic
communications strategy.

I understand there's a strategic communications working group focused on Pakistan. Would you like me to meet with
anyone to discuss this idea? I'm told Ashley Bommer is working on it. (I don't know her).
By the way - we're making headway on our campaign for Global Women's Issues - hope to have more to report soon!

Hillary,
I admire the way you handled yourself during your trip to Pakistan. It reminds me of the daunting job before you and it's
potential.
Successfully engaging the power of the DOS and the array of relevant external relationships on behalf of your goals will
remain a central challenge.
As we discussed, gathering a handful of loyal and trusted outside advisors could provide a valuable tool in this regard.
Given your late October or early November target for the first meeting, I have been working with Cheryl to come up with
a date. I guess given all that is going on possible dates seem to continually slip away.
I would understand if, in the context of everything on your plate this advisory group is just not practical. However, if you
do feel that such a gathering would be helpful and want to proceed, I believe you need to step in, select the initial date
or dates (with risk that it may need to change) and extend the invitations. A quick note to Mickey, Gordon, Maggie and
any others you want to include. Others mentioned so far include Sandy Berger, Strobe Talbott and Elaine Kamarck.
For at least the first gathering, you may want to consider two parts. A dinner, breakfast or other informal event plus a
more structured meeting would create the opportunity for informal discussion and time for reflection.
In the event you do want to move forward, I am happy to assist in any way that may be useful. Please know that I in no
way want to push this beyond where you may want to go.
Nancy

Shearer was a stalwart supporter and contributor to ICRW's mission and work. ICRW honors her commitment to women
with a fellowship program based in our Asia Regional Office in New Delhi, India, a tribute to Shearer's fond memories of
her time spent in India during her youth and her tenure on ICRW's board.
The 2009 fellow will work in collaboration with the Asia director of the social and economic development group on
programs, research, advocacy, and business development related to the group's portfolio of work. The specific activities
of the fellow will be determined based on the substantive and technical skills, interests, and experience of the candidate

Jim and Phil--
I returned his call and discussed the Macedonia name issue, Cyprus, and relations w Turkey. There's a memcon that
reflects his stated commitment to solve or improve status of these issues.
I've known him a long time and will be happy to follow up w him on any and all of these matters w your guidance. He
seems determined to put points on the board to have a fast start so we should intensify our efforts w him. Let me know
what else you want me to do. Thx.

I spoke w Secretary Solis and thanked her for going to Honduras. She is eager for your briefing and advice when you
meet w her today. And it is very important that Craig is going w her to guide her thru this process.
Oscar Arias told me he is very worried about whether the agreement will be implemented and is meeting w the
leading Presidential candidate this week to urge that he produce his party's 55 votes for restitution.
I also spoke w Insulza who is focussed on the elections which I told him we would fully support. Is there more we
should be doing?
Again, thanks for all your great work and good luck in the effort to get this across the finish line. Best, HRC

Madame Secretary:
Thank you for reaching out to Secretary Solis and convincing her to join the Verification Commission. She and Ricardo
Lagos will make for a very high profile and effective international component of the Commission.
We will meet with her this morning at 10 am to brief her for Tuesday's journey to Honduras. At this point, it appears we
have a military aircraft available. The plan is for the U.S. Delegation to depart D.C., stop in Miami to pick up Ricardo
Lagos, and arrive in Tegucigalpa together. We think this will send a powerful message to Hondurans and leave no doubt
about our commitment to seeing this process through to a successful conclusion.
You should be aware that Ambassador Hugo Llorens is under public assault. The Wall Street Journal dedicates its
America's column this morning to attacking him and calling for his removal. Last Friday, Representative Connie Mack did
the same. This chorus will grow as the extent of our accomplishment is understood. Llorens is a tough, stalwart guy. He
and his Mission have held firm during this crisis. A call from you would be a big boost.
Finally, we will hold an IPC today to identify further steps. We will keep you up to date on these steps and identify
further opportunities for your engagement.

I want to thank you for your leadership and support during this long crisis. Your willingness to engage at key moments
and take risks at the right time have propelled us much further than anyone expected. Your diplomacy prevented a
debilitating civil conflict in Honduras that would have destabilized Central America and undermined two decades of our
efforts. We now have a big opportunity in front of us, and for that we are grateful to you.
Regards,
Tom

First â€” I want to say again what a great job you have done on Food Security â€” not only the video but helping us get the
site up and ready in less than 24 hours â€” many thanks. Love the metrics below â€” makes it all worth it.
Second â€” let's set a time to discuss this new idea.
Yeah!

Subject: Video Success and Another Idea
Cheryl
Hope this finds you well. I wanted to update you on the success of the video and also share a new idea with you. Give
the statistical results below, I honestly believe this is the State Departments first ever successful instance of policy
advocacy via viral video and the impact we have raised is worth noting. I have heard comments from all over the
building and outside that this is a new level of creating content/video that is engaging, interesting, educating and that
can have long term value for State and partners to use. Bottom-line, we have done something new in raising
awareness/attention on a major foreign policy initiative through compelling, and viral video -- the Department of State
has raised the bar.
It is hard to read the traffic exactly to their sites and ours but here are some initial stats:
Top line: Using State.gov, America.gov, Facebook, Twitter, Youtube and more, we have use new media and connection
technology tools to reach over an estimated 100K audiences domestically and internationally through the video on Food
Security and ultimately have brought press and attention to a new focus. This video is engaging in that it raises
awareness and education on a critical foreign policy issue.
1. It is one of the top 20 videos viewed on our Youtube channel, with over 5K views and rising. Considering how much
video we generate through the daily press briefings and videos through S remarks daily, I think this carries tremendous
weight that in a short amount of time and little push to reach out to communities we have raised the bar for engaging
content through video.
2. Many organizations and users on Youtube have picked up the video and reposted on their channels, for examples
it is has been picked up heavily in China from one user who generated 3K views on his own already and I have been told
that it has been posted on major Ethiopian blogs through their video channels as well.
3. Over 12,000 (estimated) have visited our main video page through State.gov where the video was featured.
4. Almost 9K people have visited the Global Food Security page through State.gov to get more information.
5. ' Through pushing out on social networking presences at State, we have reached over 65,000 people who subscribe
and follow the Department of State and we pushed this video and the broader FS page to those communities through
Facebook, Twitter, and more.
Next Steps:
1. We are making DVD's to give to posts
2. Working on distributing to bloggers for continued use
3. Will feature and push video to a larger audience when op-ed runs through a second push

4. Will work to feature prominently on World Food Day
5. Working to translate and subtitle video for usage in countries around the world.
New Idea:
Cheryl, wanted to talk to you about a new idea that I have presented before but thought about using for FS in a modified
form. I discussed with Caitlin and wanted to see if you thought this was a good idea.
This proposal is to ask that Secretary Clinton begin an online conversation on Food Security where she can engage with
people at home and abroad.
1. Through a video announcement she announces the opening of a global and engaging talk worldwide talk on global
hunger and invites people to submit questions on the topic. People can submit questions via video, text, email,
comment.
2. The community votes and comments on the best questions submitted by one another and votes on the best ones.
3. After two weeks, Secretary Clinton answers then the top five questions in her own response video. *** We could
even bring person with best question to DC to be a citizen journalist for a day and ask the top questions in person.
4. We then use this video as a way to talk about the most frequently asked questions on global hunger, HRC's
responses to them and we have engaged a global community on the topic.

I can attest to the fact that this has thus far been the shining star of the initiative (from a non-policy perspective) and I
think speaks to how hrc will do diplomacy and development differently.
In addition to what katie mentioned-- Institute for International Education (goodman) included it in their weekly email to
more than 8000 institutions, Pepsi showed it an internal meeting last week and will show it at a global conference this
week, and CGI has gotten feedback about the video and has gotten increased interest in commitments in this area. It has
also been pushed out to posts through internal sites.
We are also trying to see if we can get it in a rotation or on mtvU or their website and bet as part of the world food day
push.

Will this decision be an issue for us in Germany?
Also, I heard a rumor that Phil Murphy was called in by Merkel over this? Is that true?

France: 'Autistic Tories have castrated UK in Europe'
French Europe minister says David Cameron's pledge to reclaim EU powers is 'pathetic' and will leave Britain isolated

<http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/allegrastratton>
guardian.co.uk <http://www.guardian.co.uk>, Wednesday 4 November 2009 21.30 GMT
The Conservatives <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/conservatives> were accused by the French government
tonight of ""castrating"" Britain's position within the EU by adopting an ""autistic"" approach that would take Britain off the
radar.
Speaking to the Guardian, Pierre Lellouche, France's Europe minister, described as ""pathetic"" the Tories' EU plans
announced today, warning they would not succeed ""for a minute"".
Giving vent to frustration across the EU, which has so far only been expressed in private, Lellouche â€” who said he was
reflecting Nicolas Sarkozy's ""sadness and regret"" â€” accused William Hague, the shadow foreign secretary, of a ""bizarre
autism"" in their discussions.
He said: ""They have one line and they just repeat one line. It is a very bizarre sense of autism.""
Lellouche, one of the most Anglophile members of Sarkozy's government, made his remarkable intervention after David
Cameron <http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/davidcameron> outlined a fresh Tory approach to the EU in the wake of
the full ratification of the Lisbon treaty.
A future Conservative government would seek to strengthen British sovereignty and repatriate a series of powers over
social and employment legislation, the Tory leader said.
Cameron said he was not seeking an immediate ""bust-up"" with the EU, and would allow the repatriation of powers
negotiations to last as long as five years.
But that position was not enough for the Tory MEP Daniel Hannan, who quit his role as the party's legal affairs
spokesman in Europe, saying he intended to fight for referendums to enable Britain to become ""self-governing"".
France's centre-right government condemned Cameron's plans, saying that they would marginalise Britain within the
EU.
Abandoning all diplomatic niceties, Lellouche said: ""It's pathetic. It's just very sad to see Britain, so important in Europe,
just cutting itself out from the rest and disappearing from the radar map .... This is a culture of opposition ... It is the
result of a long period of opposition. I know they will come back, but I hope the trip will be short."" He said Cameron's
approach was in line with the Tories' decision to abandon the main centre-right EPP grouping in the European
parliament, of which Sarkozy's UMP party is a member.
""They are doing what they have done in the European parliament. They have essentially castrated your UK influence in
the European parliament,"" he said.
Lellouche said he has told Hague personally that his position was a ""waste of time for all of us"".
""I have told William Hague: go away for two to three years, in your political economic situation you're going to be all by
your self and you'll come back. Go ahead and do it. That is my message to them ... You want to be marginalised? Well,
you go for it. But it's a waste of time for all of us,"" the French minister said.
Lellouche made clear the Tories had no hope of securing support for their plans. ""It's not going to happen for a minute.
Nobody is going to indulge in rewriting [treaties for] many, many years. Nobody is going to play with the institutions
again. It's going to be take it or leave it and they should be honest and say that,"" he said. ""It is a time of tumultuous
waters all around us. Wars, terrorism, proliferation, Afghanistan, energy with Russia, massive immigration, economic
crisis. It is time when the destiny of Europe is being defined â€” whether or not we will exist as a third of the world's GDP
capable of fighting it out on climateion trade, on every ... issue on the surface of the Earth.
""We need to be united, otherwise we will be wiped out and marginalised. None of us can do it alone. Whether you're big
or small, the lesson is the same. And [Britain's] risk is one of marginalisation. Irrelevance."" He explained: ""Finally we have
institutional package, but it took 15 years of looking at our navel and getting everybody bored to death with sterile
debate""
In a sign of France's determination to resist the Tory plans to opt out of key EU legislation, Lellouche warned the French
would attempt to reduce Britain's EU budget rebate which will be up for negotiation during the next parliament.
He pointed out that France is a net EU contributor to the tune of â‚¬5bn (E4.5bn), unlike Britain which receives a rebate.
""If we get a government that is ferociously anti European that will vote down this kind of legislation then I think the
relationship is going to be very difficult. As we enter the next phase one of the issues we have to discuss midterm is of

course finances. France is a net contributor to the tune of â‚¬5bn a year, of which â‚¬1.5bn is the same as British rebate.
That should tell you quite a bit huh?"" he said.
Cameron will be angered by the attack, and what it implies for Tory relations with the rest of Europe although in the
short term he will be more concerned to ensure his strategy of abandoning a referendum on the Lisbon treaty does not
provoke cries of betrayal on his backbenches.
Hague reacted to the French criticism by insisting that Lellouche's comments did not represent the true reception of the
Tories' plans in Europe.
""That is not how we are seen across Europe,"" he told BBC2's Newsnight, adding his party had established good relations
with Sarkozy's party.
""I don't think you will find that's representative of the reaction in Paris or other European capitals,"" he added.

Re: Agenda with Merkel
The Transatlantic Economic Council was Chancellor Angela Merkel's major initiative when Germany held the EU
presidency in 2007. She got President George W. Bush to agree to its formation. But the council now languishes. Has the
US appointed its representative? The council is more about coordinating regulatory matters than trade, by the way.
Raising Merkel's project and reinvigorating it would undoubtedly be well received. Below is an article from Europolitics

future By Brian Beary in Washington I Friday 16 January 2009
As Barack Obama was coasting to victory last November, the leader of the Socialist MEPs, Martin Schulz, urged him to
""make sure Europe is on the top of his in-tray"". Two months on, there is considerable doubt as to whether Obama will
indeed take this advice or leave Europe lingering towards the bottom of the pile. Nowhere is this danger more striking

than with the Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC), the body German Chancellor Angela Merkel persuaded President
George Bush to set up in April 2007 to remove regulatory barriers to transatlantic trade.
STILL NO TEC CHAIR
Obama has been widely praised for moving quickly, by comparison to previous new presidents, to nominate his new
administration. Yet his spokesman told Europolitics he has still not appointed the future co-chair of the TEC. In the
interim, Michelle O'Neill, Deputy Undersecretary at the Department of Commerce, has been tasked with ensuring
continuity. The EU Co-Chair is Commission Vice-President Gunter Verheugen. Given that dozens of nominations have
already been announced, this may be a sign that among his long list of priorities, the TEC, the most significant EU-US
initiative to emerge in recent years, will not feature highly. It should be noted that when Obama was chair of the Senate
Subcommittee on Europe, from 2007 to 2008, he did not organise a single hearing, something on which his then rival in
the presidential campaign, Senator Hillary Clinton, tried - and failed - to score political points.
The Democrats, who have grown more protectionist-minded on trade, now have a commanding majority in both the US
Senate and House of Representatives. Obama, himself a Democrat, is being careful to cultivate good relations with them
and not take for granted their support, which he desperately needs to push through his ambitious economic policy
agenda. It was Congress that in 2007 introduced the 100% rule, requiring all US-bound containers leaving European
ports to be scanned before being loaded onto the departing ship. This has been a thorn in the EU's side ever since and
now features on the TEC agenda. In the current climate, Congress is unlikely to be clamouring to scrap the rule and may
not even wish to extend the 2012 implementation deadline as the EU is asking. Anxious not to burn bridges, Obama
could well go along with Congress in order to avoid an unnecessary fight.
AMERICANS NOT SO HOT ON TRADE
Congress' protectionism does not magically appear in a vacuum. It is reflective of mounting fears among the US public
about the impact free trade has on US jobs. Their fears are not entirely groundless. American manufacturing jobs are
indeed going overseas - notably to India and China. And being unemployed in the US is a more perilous predicament
than in Europe because government unemployment benefits are less generous and more temporary. Moreover, most
Americans, unlike Europeans, have their health care paid for by their employer so if they lose their job they also lose
their health care. Hardly surprising, therefore, that only 59% of Americans think trade is good for their country,
compared to 78% of French and British, 80% of Czechs and 85% of Germans, a Pew Research Centre survey has shown.
This bearish sentiment has a knock-on effect on all trade dossiers. For example, it makes Congress less amenable to
scrapping the law requiring US airlines to be in 'actual control' of US citizens - something the EU is urging in the current
Open Sky II aviation liberalisation talks. It makes US lawmakers more likely to take action to prevent European
companies winning lucrative US defence contracts. This is happening already with the epic tussle between Boeing and
Airbus over the Pentagon's US$35 billion refuelling tanker contract (see separate article). EU officials are clinging to the
hope that Obama, as president, will adopt a more global outlook and drag the Democratic Congress along with him
rather than the other way around.
A VICTIM OF DULLNESS?
The TEC, despite having failed to deliver as much as many hoped for, remains an extremely useful tool. By emphasising
regulatory rather than tariff barriers, it shows an understanding of where the real problems lie in today's trading
environment. The EU and the US could use the TEC to create a global standard in hugely important sectors, such as toys
and food. ""The alternative,"" as Dan Hamilton, director of the Centre for Transatlantic Relations at Johns Hopkins
University in Washington notes, ""is that we end up with Chinese standards"".
Yet the TEC has one weakness no one should underestimate: its dullness. Discussing highly technical regulatory
divergences, such as whether to wash chickens in chlorine or water, may have been Chancellor Merkel's cup of tea but
French President Nicolas Sarkozy showed little interest in it during the French EU Presidency. Without strong impetus
from someone on Obama's team who has the power to make things happen, the TEC - like an old soldier - might not
actually die but just fade away.
EU-US economy
While there is much talk about the rising power of China and India, the transatlantic economy still far outstrips the rest
of the world in size and wealth. The EU27 and the US accounted for nearly 57% of world gross domestic product in 2007,
while the transatlantic economy made up 47% of world exports and 52% of world imports. The net worth per household
in the US is US$565,000, in France US$518,000, in the U.K. US$599,000, compared to just US$18,000 in China,
US$31,000 in Russia and US$44,000 Brazil.

A VICTIM OF DULLNESS?
The TEC, despite having failed to deliver as much as many hoped for, remains an extremely useful
tool. By emphasising regulatory rather than tariff barriers, it shows an understanding of where the
real problems lie in today's trading environment. The EU and the US could use the TEC to create a
global standard in hugely important sectors, such as toys and food. ""The alternative,"" as Dan Hamilton,
director of the Centre for Transatlantic Relations at Johns Hopkins University in Washington notes, ""is
that we end up with Chinese standards"".
Yet the TEC has one weakness no one should underestimate: its dullness. Discussing highly technical
regulatory divergences, such as whether to wash chickens in chlorine or water, may have been
Chancellor Merkel's cup of tea but French President Nicolas Sarkozy showed little interest in it during
the French EU Presidency. Without strong impetus from someone on Obama's team who has the power

to make things happen, the TEC - like an old soldier - might not actually die but just fade away.
EU-US economy
While there is much talk about the rising power of China and India, the transatlantic economy
still far outstrips the rest of the world in size and wealth. The EU27 and the US accounted for
nearly 57% of world gross domestic product in 2007, while the transatlantic economy made up
47% of world exports and 52% of world imports. The net worth per household in the US is
US$565,000, in France US$518,000, in the U.K. US$599,000, compared to just US$18,000 in
China, US$31,000 in Russia and US$44,000 Brazil.

Holds, delays on Cabinet picks hurting American businesses
By Nelson W. Cunningham - 10/06/09 03:45 PM ET
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760158 Date: 07/31/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760158 Date: 07/31/2015
You may never have heard of the Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, or the Under Secretary of
Treasury for International Affairs. You may have vaguely assumed there was a Deputy United States Trade
Representative, and an Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs, and an ambassador to Brazil, but
never thought much of them or what they do.
But ask American CEOs and business leaders who they turn to in Washington for help getting a fair shake in foreign
markets or untying global trade knots, and you will learn that these are the very officials they rely on. Yet today, when
every export dollar and trade-supported job is essential to America's economic recovery, these key positions sit empty.
And, surprisingly, these five seats are empty because of stalls and behind-the-scenes maneuvers by Senate Republicans
â€” usually key allies of U.S. business.
In each case, the names went up months ago. The nominees have strong credentials and many have demonstrated
strong bipartisan support. The reasons for the holds and delays vary. But even if the blocking actions are unrelated,
collectively they deny American businesses their most effective overseas advocates.
â€¢Miriam Sapiro, who was unanimously approved by the Finance Committee in July to be Deputy United States Trade
Representative with responsibility for trade agreements and enforcement with Europe and the Americas (including
NAFTA), has a one-man hold by Sen. Jim Bunning (R-Ky.) over a Canadian tobacco bill.
â€¢Arturo Valenzuela, nominee for Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere, was overwhelmingly approved by
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in July, but Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) has a one-man hold on Valenzuela as a
protest against the administration's Honduras policy.
â€¢Thomas Shannon, nominee for ambassador to Brazil, is also being blocked by Sen. DeMint over Honduras. Shannon is
hardly political, but is a career foreign service officer who was President Bush's top official for Latin America at the NSC
and then the State Department.
â€¢Francisco Sanchez, nominated in April to be Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, responsible for
advancing U.S. export and trade opportunities around the world. Republican staff under Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) on
the Finance Committee have repeatedly delayed a hearing.
â€¢Lael Brainard, nominated in March to be Under Secretary of Treasury for International Affairs, is also being held up by
the Republican staff on the Finance Committee. With an empty chair in this powerful position â€” it was previously held
by future Treasury Secretaries Timothy Geithner and Lawrence Summers â€” our ability to coordinate a response to the
financial crisis is hampered at a time when we can't afford it.
Who is hurt by these holds and staff delays? Certainly the president, who is facing the worst economic crisis in 50 years,
a stalled trade agenda, and economic and political turmoil in many parts of Latin America, including the hot-button crisis
in Honduras.
But U.S. businesses are also hurt. When American companies find themselves in commercial or trade disputes abroad, or
face unfair competition from foreign companies or discriminatory practices from regulators, they turn directly to the
roster above. With all these chairs empty, U.S. businesses with problems abroad find themselves facing a classic
Goldilocks problem â€” the Cabinet secretaries above are too big (and too busy), and the officials below are too small to
have an impact at the right levels.
Moreover, the international economic issues of greatest interest to U.S. businesses are precisely the ones that are being
hampered by these vacancies: balanced and coordinated growth out of the Great Recession, promotion of job-
generating U.S. exports, delayed trade agreements with Colombia and Panama, barriers into Brazil's huge market, trade
tensions with Canada (our largest trading partner) and security and border issues with Mexico (our second-largest),
among many others.

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760158 Date: 07/31/2015
And while all U.S. business interests overseas are affected by these vacancies, it is our business and political interests in
the Americas that are being hit most directly, because of the responsibilities and expertise of the five nominees.
Predictably, this lamentable situation is renewing cries from our neighbors that even under a promising new president,
they continue to be neglected. And as importantly, our ability to help shape political and economic events in our
hemisphere to advance U.S. interests is suffering greatly. Who wins when we can't act? Our foreign competitors; not
just foreign companies, but Hugo Chavez and his anti-democratic allies.
All this is not to cast blame on the United States Senate, which has a constitutional duty to provide ""advice and consent""
on presidential nominations (though it may cause one to question the tradition that permits a single senator to put an
indefinite hold on a nominee). Nor is it to cast blame solely on Republican members or staff. Democratic senators and
their staffs used these same parliamentary maneuvers under Republican presidents.
But it is to say that those who engage in those tactics now â€” at a time of global economic crisis and with growing
financial, trade and political frictions in our own hemisphere â€” should be reminded of the harm done to important U.S.
interests. In the days after 9/11, the Democratically-controlled Senate moved swiftly to confirm the U.N. ambassador
and other stalled security-related posts. Today's circumstances are not the same by any means, but as we confront the
worst economic crisis in over 50 years, these are surely no ordinary times.
The time has come for the Senate to carry out its constitutional duty and to end the delays on these five key commerce
and trade nominations. American business deserves an A Team by its side.

Clinton set to smooth Obama's visit to China
By Edward Luce in Washington and Geoff Dyer in Beijing
Published: November 4 2009 02:00 I Last updated: November 4 2009 02:00
Hillary Clinton is on course to raise the $61m in private money needed to build a US pavilion for a trade fair in Shanghai
next year, Clearing one of the main foreign policy obstacles ahead of Barack Obama's state visit to China next week.
Mrs Clinton, whose first visit as secretary of state was to China, inherited a situation where the US was the only country
other than Andorra that had failed to confirm its attendance at the Shanghai Expo - to the chagrin of the Chinese.
America's absence from the fair, running from May to October, was the first issue to be raised by the Chinese when Mrs
Clinton visited in February. ""The Chinese were very upset,"" says Elizabeth Baghley, who heads Mrs Clinton's office for
global partnerships. ""When she came back from China she said: 'Whatever it takes, this matters to China and to US
business and we are going to get this done'.""
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760164 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760164 Date: 06/30/2015
The task was more arduous than expected. Unlike all the other participants in what is expected to be the largest trade
fair in history, the US administration is barred by federal law from spending a single public dollar on global trade fairs.
Mrs Clinton, who has extensive experience at fundraising as a presidential and senatorial candidate, was also prevented
from asking for money herself.
The bureaucratic obstacles were made worse by the fact the Chinese had already tapped large US companies, such as
Cisco and Coca-Cola, to spend money on their own corporate pavilions, which will face their national counterparts
across the river around the fair in Shanghai. The situation was retrieved when three companies - Chevron, GE and
PepsiCo - were persuaded to put up $5m (â‚¬3.4m, Â£3m) each. So far $46m has been pledged.
Mrs Clinton's emphasis on getting a US pavilion contrasted strongly with the attitude of the Bush administration. Some
even referred disparagingly to the ""Chi-comms"" - an old-fashioned abbreviation for Chinese communists. ""The state
department basically saw it as a lost cause,"" says one state department official. ""Some people laughed when they heard
Hillary wanted to do this.""
Shanghai has huge hopes for the Expo, which it sees as a chance to cement the city's global brand as an international
financial centre and modern metropolis. With an official budget of Rmb28.6bn ($4.2bn) and 70m expected visitors over
the six months, the Expo has been marketed as the sort of coming-out party for Shanghai that last year's Olympics was
for Beijing - and an event to rival the great 19th century world fairs in London, Paris and Chicago.
Given such heady expectations for what will be the world's largest fair, the absence of the US would have been
considered a huge slight and a loss of face for the Chinese. Mindful of how much it mattered to the Chinese, Mrs Clinton
saw it as an opportunity to build their trust. During strategic and economic talks with Chinese counterparts in
Washington last summer, Mrs Clinton vowed she would get it done even if she had to ""build it myself, brick by brick"".
Mrs Clinton was also backed by John Huntsman, the US ambassador to China and former governor of Utah, who
repeatedly told Washington how much symbolic value it would bring to China.
Mrs Clinton, who will be with the US president on his state visit next week, is expected to visit the site and may be in a
position to announce that all the money has been raised.

Hillary's Moment: Clinton Faces the World By Joe Klein Time Magazine Wednesday, Nov. 04, 2009
It was Halloween night in Jerusalem, and Benjamin Netanyahu came dressed as a peacemaker. ""We're prepared to start
peace talks immediately,"" the notoriously reluctant Israeli Prime Minister proclaimed, with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton standing at his side, poker-faced. ""I think we should ... get on it and get with it.""
It was a ploy, of course. The Palestinians were tangled up in themselves, yet again. They had elections looming, and their
leader, Mahmoud Abbas, had to hang tough: he was demanding a total freeze to Israeli settlement-building on the West
Bank â€” which was precisely what the Obama Administration had previously said it favored. Netanyahu was offering a
partial freeze, not including new settlements in East Jerusalem, the desired capital of a future Palestinian state. This was
a nonstarter for the Palestinians, but it had the holographic glow of a step forward. It was an ""unprecedented"" offer,
Netanyahu trumpeted, with the joy of a chess master springing a trap.(See photos from 60 years of Israel.)
It was a tough moment for Clinton, playing second fiddle at the Bibi-does-Gandhi show. President Barack Obama had
softened his language on the settlements a few weeks earlier: instead of a total freeze, he had talked about Israeli
""restraint"" in settlement-building. And now Clinton seemed to cement the Administration's retreat, agreeing that
Netanyahu's proposal was, indeed, ""unprecedented,"" even though the U.S. still favored a total freeze. The most
important thing, she added, was for the parties to get to the table as quickly as possible. The onus was back on the
Palestinians â€” and the Palestinians quickly expressed outrage at the Obama Administration's retreat. Their Arab
neighbors soon joined in, causing Clinton to backtrack two days later, telling reporters the Israeli plan ""falls far short"" of
U.S. expectations, although she still insisted on calling it ""unprecedented,"" which was neither diplomatic nor wise.
Suddenly the Obama Administration seemed wobbly on the Middle East; clearly, Clinton had been too bullish on
Netanyahu's proposal (which had been negotiated over months with Middle East envoy George Mitchell and was seen,
privately, by the Americans as real progress). But the Administration's mission was to get the parties into peace talks
without preconditions. The Israelis were now in favor of talks. The Palestinians were setting preconditions. And Clinton
had violated an essential rule of her job: boring is almost always better.(See photos from the life and career of former
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.)
Clinton's Three Qualities
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760165 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760165 Date: 06/30/2015
For the past 40 years, the awkward Middle East press conference has helped define the job of Secretary of State. You go
to Jerusalem or Ramallah; you stand there ""guardedly optimistic"" in public; in private, you try to move a comma, but the
Israelis or Palestinians move a semicolon to block your comma. The result is almost always the same: gridlock. The
breakthroughs, when they come, emanate from others. Walter Cronkite asks Anwar Sadat if he'd be willing to go to
Jerusalem ... and Sadat, to everyone's surprise, says yes. The Israelis and Palestinians hold secret meetings in Oslo and
reach what appears to be a breakthrough â€” they're talking! â€” which then becomes another dead end.
The job of Secretary of State is more thankless than glamorous; in some ways, the Department of State, a noble antique,
is still trying to come to terms with the invention of the telephone. In an era when Twitter haiku-messaging rules,
diplomacy moves at the speed, and requires the nuanced complexity, of literature. Power has drifted from State to the
National Security Council and the Pentagon, especially in wartime. Only a few of Clinton's recent predecessors have
distinguished themselves. Henry Kissinger, a National Security Adviser who belatedly became Secretary of State, was
Richard Nixon's schizophrenic alter ego; George Shultz was a strong policy voice in the Reagan Administration; James
Baker had clout because he was George H.W. Bush's best friend and a world-class dealmaker. Most of the others have
been frustrated or forgettable. And yet this is Hillary Clinton we're talking about â€” the second most popular American in
the world, an eternally compelling and supremely talented character, the subject of constant speculation, a walking
headline. Her very presence in the job makes it crucial once more.
It is a clichÃ© to say that by naming Clinton, Obama brought his most popular potential opponent into the tent. The
conventional wisdom, too cynical by half, is that he thereby succeeded in neutering her, a theory bolstered by Clinton's
reticence during her first nine months on the job, with special envoys like Mitchell and Richard Holbrooke doing the
heavy lifting of diplomacy. But by naming Clinton, Obama also gave her great power, which cuts both ways: if she
becomes dissatisfied with her role or the Administration's policies, she can become a torpedo aimed at the Oval Office.
Colin Powell had similar power and a real gripe â€” the Iraq war â€” but never used it. Clinton has no such gripe, but as the
Obama Administration settles in and policy differences begin to emerge among the key players, the Powell conundrum
looms: How will Clinton choose to use her power? How will Obama react if and when she does?
Traditionally, the Secretary of State is judged on his or her ability to formulate policy, negotiate deals and manage the
striped-pants bureaucracy. Clinton has no history as a global strategist, although her performance in the 2008 campaign
indicates that she is a bit more conservative than the President, more the foreign policy realist than the Wilsonian
idealist. It is also too early to judge her skill as a manager or negotiator â€” although her performance in Jerusalem
indicates that she needs a few lessons in Middle East Haggling 101.
There are, however, three qualities that could make her a memorable Secretary of State. She brings a vision of
departmental reform â€” the need to elevate foreign aid programs to the same status and rigorous scrutiny as diplomacy
â€” that could change striped pants into chinos in the developing world. She is also the first elected politician to hold the
office since Edmund Muskie briefly did during the Carter Administration, which has enabled her to better understand
and interact with the politicians who run places like Afghanistan and Pakistan. But most important, she is an
international celebrity with a much higher profile than any of her recent predecessors and the ability â€” second only to
the President's â€” to change negative attitudes about the U.S. abroad.
She has the potential to become the most powerful public diplomat the U.S. has fielded in quite some time, although
her performance so far, at home and abroad, has occasionally been perplexing. At home, she has often seemed
tentative and deferential. In a conversation with Secretary of Defense Robert Gates aired by CNN in early October,
Clinton's cautious formality took a backseat to Gates' brisk, humorous confidence on policy issues. Abroad, she seems
far more confident, at times to the point of recklessness, as in Jerusalem. (See photos of the last days of Hillary Clinton's
campaign.)
Independence and Candor
In the last week of October, Secretary Clinton moved squarely to the center of the world stage, attempting, at the
behest of her special envoys, to improve the rocky alliance with Pakistan and nudge the Middle East pugilists into talks.
In the course of the trip, there were the first stray wisps of a hint that Clinton wanted to begin asserting her
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760165 Date: 06/30/2015
UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760165 Date: 06/30/2015
independence, as the Administration, facing roadblocks across the world, struggled for a firmer foreign policy tone after
an opening nine months that might be called the Rodney King â€” ""Can't we all just get along?"" â€” phase.
During her three days in Pakistan, she ran a gauntlet of town-hall meetings and media interviews that may have been
unprecedented, to use the word of the week, for a U.S. Secretary of State. The trip, planned by Holbrooke and Pakistan
specialist Vali Nasr, offered an unusually subtle itinerary for a U.S. diplomatic mission. A visit to a Sufi mosque that had
been bombed by Sunni extremists, for example, sent a powerful message to Pakistan's moderate Islamic majority. ""We
saw her praying there,"" an academic named Shala Aziz told me, ""and, for the first time, I'm thinking, The Americans have
hearts.""(See photos of the suicide bombings in Islamabad.)
The big news was that Clinton allowed herself to be hammered with hostile questions from students, talk-show hosts
and Pashtun elders â€” and that, on occasion, she pushed back, raising incredibly sensitive issues, like why no one in the
Pakistani government knew where Osama bin Laden was, even though he had been in the country since 2002. Press
accounts either emphasized the embarrassment of a Secretary of State's getting pummeled or fixed on Clinton's
undiplomatic bluntness. But they missed the point: her candor, her willingness to listen to and acknowledge criticism,
had begun to undermine the prevailing Pakistani image of the U.S. as arrogant and bossy, more interested in having the
Pakistani military fight its war against al-Qaeda and the Taliban than in having a true strategic partnership. The contrast
was especially sharp after George W. Bush's eight years of unqualified support for the military dictatorship of Pervez
Musharraf. ""In the past, when the Americans came, they would talk to the generals and go home,"" said Farahnaz
Ispahani, a government spokeswoman and Member of Parliament. ""Clinton's willingness to meet with everyone, hostile
or not, has made a big impression â€” and because she's Hillary Clinton, with a real history of affinity for this country, it
means so much more.""
Transformative Experience
There are no toasts at state dinners in Pakistan, because there is no alcohol. There are opening statements, though, and
Clinton's â€” delivered impromptu on the first night of her trip after tossing aside her notes â€” was surprisingly emotional.
Earlier in the day, President Asif Ali Zardari, the widower of Benazir Bhutto, had presented the Secretary with an album
of photos from her first visit to Pakistan, in 1995, and a framed photo of Bhutto and her two sons with Clinton and
daughter Chelsea. ""It did bring tears to my eyes,"" Clinton said at the state dinner in her honor at the presidential palace,
""because I so admired your wife. She gave her life ..."" She faltered then, choking up, but quickly pulled herself together,
talking about the ""reasons why we do what we do â€” to provide opportunities for all.""
Clinton's first trip to Pakistan as First Lady in 1995 had been a transformative experience for her â€” the beginning, I
believe, of the process that made her a plausible candidate for Secretary of State. I traveled with her on that trip; when
we set off, she seemed depressed and even more private than usual. The Democrats had cratered in the 1994
congressional elections, and she had been trounced in her efforts to enact a universal health care plan. It was a very
personal defeat; as Clinton traveled the country trying to sell the plan, crowds shouted her down and cursed her.
Privately she admitted she was shocked by the hatred. The trip to South Asia seemed a bit of a vacation â€” it was
Chelsea's spring break â€” but also a retreat to a more demure, First Ladyâ€“like role after two years as health care policy
czar, although it proceeded in a decidedly wonky, Hillarian fashion. Jackie Kennedy had gone to India and famously
ridden an elephant; Hillary Clinton traveled to five countries and packed her schedule with visits to NG0s.
""That was the greatest trip, just unbelievable,"" Clinton says now. We were sitting in her hotel suite the day after her
Jerusalem gaffe, the Secretary in an electric-blue shift rather than her usual formal jacket and pants. She was wearing
glasses and appeared rather freckly without her makeup. ""I guess that trip has animated and informed everything I've
done since,"" she said. She emerged from the trip reinvigorated, with a new mission. By the end of 1995, at the U.N.
Conference on Women in Beijing, the First Lady had propounded a new Clinton Doctrine: ""Women's rights are human
rights.""(See photos of Beijing's changing skyline.)
Clinton is not an easy interview. She is preternaturally cautious, a consequence of her Methodist propriety and 20 years
of insane public scrutiny. She does not like to talk about herself, but she did tell me one interesting story about Bhutto.
When her husband was governor of Arkansas, she and Bill and Chelsea visited London and stood on the sidewalk outside

Bhutto's hotel, waiting for the then Pakistani Prime Minister to arrive. ""She was wearing a yellow embroidered shalwar
kameez with a chiffon scarf. I was just a fan, standing on the sidewalk with everyone else. It was the only time I ever did
anything like that,"" Clinton says.
When Clinton and Bhutto met formally, on the first day of the 1995 trip, they hit it off immediately, in part because
Bhutto was also obsessed with the impact the Islamist tide was having on women and children. I remember asking
Bhutto that day what the biggest change in her country had been over the past 25 years, and she said, ""I used to be able
to walk down the street wearing jeans, without a headscarf. Now I can't."" When I asked her why, she said â€” bluntly â€”
""The Saudis,"" who had been aggressively funding religious schools. Of course, Bhutto's acquiescence to, and
participation in, the general corruption of the Pakistani government was part of the reason public schools were so
inadequate and madrasahs became popular. (See photos from the aftermath of Benazir Bhutto's assassination in 2007.)
Ironically, the rise of Sunni extremist groups like al-Qaeda has brought Clinton's interests â€” microfinance, education and
health care â€” to the center of national-security policy for the first time. The impetus came not from the State
Department but from the military, where counterinsurgency doctrine demanded that social services in war zones â€”
schools, justice, economic development â€” reinforce the military's efforts to secure the population. As a result, there
was immediate chemistry between Clinton and General David Petraeus, author of the Army's counterinsurgency
manual, who became one of her prime military mentors when she served on the Senate Armed Services Committee. At
one point, well before Obama made his presidential intentions known, I asked Petraeus if there was any potential
Democratic candidate who understood how his mind worked, and he said, ""You mean, aside from Hillary?""
It was Clinton who brought together Petraeus and Holbrooke (""my two alpha males,"" she calls them) for the first time â€”
at her home in Washington on the Friday before the Obama Inauguration. The affection and respect she gained for the
military while serving in the Senate has helped make the relationship between State and the Pentagon less fraught than
usual â€” although Defense Secretary Gates' insistence on the need for bigger State Department budgets hasn't hurt. In
fact, relations with the Pentagon have gone smoother, at times, than Clinton's relationship with the White House staff.
Clinton was particularly irritated by the ridiculously strict vetting process that thwarted her favored candidate for USAID
director, Paul Farmer, from getting the job. ""It was all sorts of niggling things,"" says a Clinton adviser, ""like, Farmer had
at one point brought more than $10,000 in cash into Haiti. The money was for a needle-exchange program, but the
amount was illegal.""
Another of Clinton's military mentors, retired General Jack Keane, once told me, ""I'm a Republican. I disagree with her
about practically everything, but she'd make a hell of a Commander in Chief."" There is a palpable toughness to the
woman, a hard edge that contrasts with the President's instinctive impulse toward conciliation. One of the sharpest
exchanges of the presidential campaign came when Obama accused Clinton of echoing the ""bluster"" of George W. Bush
after she said the U.S. would be able to ""obliterate"" Iran if it used nuclear weapons against Israel. Clinton's edgier tone
has been evident from the start of the Administration: she took a sharper position than the President on an Israeli
settlement freeze by claiming, in May, that Obama wanted ""to see a stop to settlements. Not some settlements, not
outposts, not natural-growth exceptions."" And then, in Jerusalem, her use of the word unprecedented seemed a
rhetorical leap beyond the No Drama ground rules.(Read ""Clinton's Collateral Damage."")
The White House was not entirely thrilled with either statement. But then the White House staff is several steps
removed from a negotiating process. The Palestinians are weak and divided. The Israelis have been difficult, as always:
whenever Mitchell raises East Jerusalem in talks with the Israeli Foreign Minister, the Israeli stands up and walks out of
the room. Despite Netanyahu's momentary, tactical enthusiasm for peace talks, his Likud Party has always favored the
de facto incorporation of Palestinian lands into the state of Israel.
Hillary's Choice
The tensions between the White House and State raise a fascinating question going forward. Obama and Clinton are in
substantive agreement on the President's diplomacy-first philosophy and on most policy issues â€” although neither is
willing to disclose the content of their private conversations â€” but style often predicts substance in foreign policy;
neither Obama's gauziness nor Clinton's inconsistent bluntness overseas seems particularly solid. There is a growing

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760165 Date: 06/30/2015
perception that the Administration's policies have been thwarted across the board: Afghanistan is a mess, Iran seems
ready to scuttle the nuclear negotiations, there's no progress in the Middle East, the Syrians and North Koreans remain
recalcitrant, the Russians have been offered a freebie on missile defense, and the Chinese have been given a pass on
human rights with no apparent quid pro quos.
The White House argues that some progress has been made: Iran is on the defensive, and North Korea has said it will
return to the six-party talks. Clinton argues, correctly, about the need for ""strategic patience."" But the only thing Obama
really has to show for his efforts so far is a Nobel Prize for Potential and â€” no small thing â€” the wisdom to have
refrained from doing anything so wildly stupid as invading Iraq. The President has been willing to use military force â€”
the Predator drones that have decimated al-Qaeda's leadership testify to his lack of squeamishness â€” but this
Administration is supposed to be about the efficacy of using subtler expressions of U.S. power. That doesn't happen
overnight, but for Obama's policies to be considered a success, it has to happen sooner or later, in a way that can be
explained to the public.
There is also a growing sense that the President's inexperience is beginning to show â€” not in his overall policy, which
represents the views of a broad, moderate national-security consensus ranging from Brent Scowcroft to John Kerry, but
in his execution of the details. The Afghan strategy review has been too public and taken too long; the Middle East peace
hunt has become a wild goose chase. A letter to Iran's Supreme Leader is a productive gesture only if it gets a response;
if it doesn't, it seems weak and supplicatory. A call for the Israelis to freeze settlements is effective only if it is
accompanied by the credible threat of a reduction in aid. ""You can't be seen pushing countries around â€” demanding
[that] Israel freeze settlements, demanding that Hamid Karzai reform his government â€” and not get results,"" says Leslie
H. Gelb, author of Power Rules. ""The leaders of these countries are tough, successful politicians, and they'll begin to take
you less seriously."" (See photos from the 1979 revolution in Iran.)
Clinton is unwilling to acknowledge these problems, and her staff is loath to admit her occasional mistakes. Her praise
for the President is fulsome, and aides say the relationship with Obama really â€” really â€” is strong. But there are also
burblings and emanations from Clinton's staff and friends, Foggy Bottom body language, that suggest there is a need for
the Administration to produce a second act after the Rodney King phase. And the White House is perplexed by the
uncharacteristic lack of discipline indicated by Clinton's occasional overseas gaffes.
These tensions are well within the boundaries of normal, creative policymaking. There is absolutely no indication that
the Secretary is frustrated to the point of jumping ship â€” or returning to politics as a candidate for governor of New
York, as has been rumored. Quite the contrary, she seems intent on making history as Secretary of State. To do that,
though, she will have to have the same authority at home as she has abroad. She will have to become the President's
primary foreign policy voice. Over the first nine months of the Obama Administration, seven different Obama officials
have spoken on the Sunday talk shows about foreign policy. Clinton has been on each of the Sunday shows once. ""Either
you have one person sending the foreign policy message, with the clear approval of the President,"" says a former
Republican Secretary of State, ""or there is no message.""(See photos from eight months of Obama's diplomacy.)
Aides to Obama say they would like to see her on the Sunday shows more often. (Indeed, Clinton's staff acknowledged
that she was asked to appear two additional times but was traveling and unable to do so.) Ultimately, though, television
is a metaphor for the larger questions that need to be resolved: How much can these former rivals â€” both extremely
guarded and private people â€” really trust each other; and, if not Clinton, who will emerge as the President's alter ego
on foreign policy? At this point, the strongest member of Obama's national-security team is Gates â€” but he's a
Republican and an unlikely spokesman or presidential confidant on anything beyond Pentagon issues. General Jim Jones
has settled in as National Security Adviser, but he's not a political animal â€” and every President needs a close foreign
policy adviser who understands the intersection of long-term strategy, politics and diplomatic chess.
Clinton's value to the Administration was clear in Pakistan. She wowed a public so skeptical that it had been questioning
the $7.5 billion in purely economic and humanitarian aid the Administration had promised. ""How much damage control
have you been able to do on this trip?"" asked Meher Bokhari, a television-news-show host, at the end of Clinton's
meeting with Pakistani women. The Secretary seemed nonplussed by the bluntness of the question. ""I don't know,"" she
said. ""I hope some.""

UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05760165 Date: 06/30/2015
Afterward, I asked Bokhari to answer her own question. ""Well, this trip was long overdue,"" she said. ""The Pakistani
people really needed to talk to an American about our concerns â€” the strings attached to aid programs, the drone
attacks, their history of support for the military dictatorship. And it needs to be followed up. But if you ask me about the
damage control"" â€” she paused, thinking it through â€” ""I'd have to say a lot. She accomplished a lot.""
In the end, though, Clinton's success will be determined by whether she can expand her role beyond public diplomat.
She will have to become a more sure-handed negotiator and, most important, a trusted adviser to a President who
knows where he wants to go in the world but hasn't quite figured out how to get there.

I have to say that this argument that the Taliban are ok to ignore is dangerous morally and politically.
The argument at the time was that harboring terrorism was the same as launching terrorism and that those who
harbored would be held responsible. This also had long term deterrence value against regimes that would outsource the
dirty work.
To now even consider giving the Taliban a pass after harboring terrorists who committed direct attacks on new York and
Washington defies the imagination. This wasn't some embassy bombing but a strike right at our country. The white
house or congress barely escaped destruction. Saddam Hussein wasn't connected to al Qaeda but the Taliban surely
were without question.
And Teheran and north Korea are watching carefully, gauging how much resolve the us has in stopping their plans. If the
us lets the Taliban off the hook then they certainly can conclude it will do nothing beyond sanctions with them. And
essentially letting karzai twist in the wind also suggests the us does not live up to it's commitments, giving pause to
those who would help the us.
Politically, this is also quite dangerous. Obama maintained througout the campaign and the start of his presidency that
this is the one to fight and backing down here makes him and the administration vulnerable to losing moderate support
and seeming weak and indecisive.
A single terrorist incident would be blamed on the admin. failing to do the job right.
I could go on and on with other negative ramifications but of all the options it appears to me any strategy that says
fighting the taliban are not in the strategic interests of the us should be doa.

Eight years ago I was standing on a hill 50 miles north of Kabul watching the flashes in the night sky as the US air strikes
started again st the Taliban front line. There were a few ineffective puffs of fire from Taliban anti-aircraft guns which
could do nothing against the bombs and missiles raining down on them.
It was a strange war to cover, not least because so little real fighting took place. The reputation of the Afghan fighting
man is partly based on agilely joining the winning side at the right moment. In the meantime they don't fight too hard
for anybody and try to avoid getting killed.
The US and British press mostly reported the war of 2001 as a real military conflict and rather missed the point that the
Taliban had just gone home. I remember visiting the former headquarters of a Taliban armoured brigade in the city of
Ghazni south west of Kabul. The tanks and armoured vehicles had all been smashed to pieces by American bombs, but
when I asked local people how many men the Taliban had lost, I was told ""none at all. They could see what was going to
happen so they just ran away.""
Just as the US military victory of 2001 was overstated, so eight years later is the sense of military crisis which is being
busily stoked by Gen Stanley A McChrystal, the top US and NATO commander in Afghanistan. In Washington military
officials are quoted as saying that the war will be won or lost in the next twelve months.

This is nonsense. The Taliban have been able to advance so rapidly in the last three years because they have Pakistani
backing and because of the spectacular political and military weakness of President Hamid Karzai's government. But the
Taliban draw all their strength from the Pashtun community, which makes up 42 per cent of the Afghan population.
They will have great difficulty advancing into areas occupied by the other 58 per cent of the population where there is a
Tajik, Hazara or Uzbek majority.
Squads of six or eight Taliban on motorcycles might be harassing the roads around Kabul, but there is no need to treat
them as if they were North Vietnamese divisions at the gates of Saigon in 1975.
The strength of the Taliban is that not that they can take and hold territory, but that they can inflict quite small military
losses on the US which are politically unacceptable back home. They can do this through roadside bombs, something the
US army speaks as if it were a new device, though it was being used against the British army in Ireland in 1921. If the
Americans and British try to hold territory supposedly cleared of Taliban with penny packets of troops then these are
vulnerable to being suddenly targeted by the other side.
It is to prevent this happening that Gen McChrystal has asked for an extra 40,000 soldiers. But Afghans tell me that more
foreign troops will simply mean more violence and dead Afghans as more of the country becomes a battlefield. It is
absurd to imagine that the world's most heavily equipped military force is not going to use its weapons when it comes
under attack. Polls also show that Taliban support is at its height in just those areas where Afghan civilians have been
killed by American shells and bombs.
So what should Obama do? First of all he has time. He is not going to win or lose the war in the next year. Like it or not
he is stuck with Mr Karzai and he should get used to the idea. It is reasonable to suggest helping to produce a larger
Afghan army and police force but this cannot be done overnight. Most military recruits are there for the money and are
too malnourished even to wear American flack jackets. Speeding up security training f or Afghan police meant over the
summer that terrified men, often on heroin, were being sent to man dangerous and isolated police posts with just three
weeks training. Many of them did not come back.
One way Obama could strengthen the Afghan army and police is to make sure their men are paid properly. In Kabul
many facilities are being guarded by policemen earning $70 a month, which is not enough to live on unless
supplemented with bribes. This contrasts with $250,000 a year paid to foreign consultants who lurk inside heavily
defended compounds. Paying the Iraqi army properly really did make a difference in Baghdad and might do the same in
Afghanistan where 40 per cent of men are unemployed. A difference is that Iraqi oil revenues last year were $62 billion
while the Afghan government is dependent on foreign aid.
The US and its allies will have to pay. It is carefully thought out measures like this that Obama should be considering and
not the panicky dispatch of US Special Forces or tens of thousand of more troops.

Re: Berlin speeches
Below are my notes for speeches in Berlin. The themes I stress are these: the importance of Berlin and the Brandenburg
Gate as symbols of freedom; the weight of history (always felt by Germans); the contribution of the US and the salience
of the Western alliance; the meaning of 1989 to today and especially the continuity of the Western alliance; and segue
from past to future.
What I have not done here but might be added are references to Angela Merkel (a courageous woman from the east
who embodies the highest values of the West); and specific policies. Those can be fitted in.
So, some ideas and language:
Twenty years ago the wall fell. Here, in Berlin, the moment when tens of thousands of citizens tore it down with
hammers and picks and bare hands is called ""Die Wende,"" a phrase that means more than simply a change but a turning
point in history. It was not only a turning point for Germany and Europe but also for the United States because the
wallâ€”the reason for its construction and the reason for its destructionâ€”is central to our common historyâ€”and to our
common future.

Richard von Weizsaecker said, ""As long as the Brandenburg Gate is closed, the German question will remain open.""
Today I can say with finality, the German question is closed, because the Brandenburg Gate is wide open! The gate is
open, Europe is open, and our future together is open.
In the forty years from the Berlin airlift to the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Atlantic partnership proved itself the most
successful alliance for freedom in history. That alliance was, is and shall be the crowning achievement of American
foreign policy. And the German â€“ American relationship has always served as its foundation. Our alliance represents the
reconciliation of former enemies, an inspiration to other peoples and continents devastated by war and hatred, and it
must never be taken for granted.
In the twenty years since the fall of the wall we have created architecture for an enduring peace. Instead of a wall we
have built a gateway to the future. President Kennedy said in 1963 that in the future free men everywhere will say, ""Ich
bin emn Berliner."" Today Berlin has gained a new and even more powerful meaning. Forever into the future, the opening
of this Gate will be the symbol of the return of the dream of freedom, not only to Berlin and Germany, but to the entire
world.
The Gate, we must remember, was not built as a symbol of freedom. And each of the tyrannies that used the Gate as a
symbol believed it represented their eternal power. The Gate was first erected as a symbol against the French
Revolution; then it became a symbol of the imperial ambitions of Napoleon who marched his army through. It was a
symbol of Prussian militarism and monarchy. It was seized by the Nazi Party as the symbol of its 1000 year rule. And
then it became a symbol of the Communist totalitarianism that built a wall to separate the people of Berlin as though
freedom could be contained in only one part of the city. Here, in Berlin, the Cold War was coldest.
We celebrate the fact that the wall that marred this proud city was taken down by the world's most enthusiastic
wrecking crew. The United States always believed in the freedom of Berlin because we believed in the future of
freedom. The courageous citizens of East Germany, Poland and other nations of the Communist bloc demonstrated their
dedication to free and peaceful solution of conflicts through their stand against dictatorship. America stood resolutely as
an ally at every moment of this struggle and moved swiftly to help the peoples of Europe reunite after 1989.
We celebrate the steadiness of purpose, the restraint and respect for ultimate goals that allowed the Cold War to end in
peace. For how the victory was won was essential to the triumph. 1989 was special. It was that rarest of historical
events: a revolution that did not descend into violence. As a result the Gate survives not as a cautionary monument to
history's darkest moments but to its brightest. Today we celebrate the revolution of 1989, the turning point that
transformed the Brandenburg Gate into the symbol of the hope of democracy and the promise of freedom.
Berliner Luft, the air of Berlin, has always been unique. I can feel and smell the spirit of freedom in your streets. The
great American poet Carl Sandburg called Berlin the Chicago of Europe. Chicago is where I was born and raised. I can
sense the same energy, openness and dedication to hard work in both great cities. Another Chicagoan, President Barack
Obama, was drawn to Berlin last July, a city that he said made him feel like a citizen of the world and a citizen of the
future.
I was very proud to visit our new Embassy at the Brandenburg Gate, located exactly where the Wall used to run. Our
presence here will forever underscore our determination that the spark of freedom from this city in 1989 will help light
the torches of freedom throughout the world.
The revolution of 1989 did not mark the end of history. Having made history together, we are summoned to secure
freedom for future generations. As vital at the beginning of the 21st century as it was in the last half of the 20th, the
Western alliance is called to new tasks. The dreams of 1989 reached farâ€”and have farther to reach. Old hatreds and
conflictsâ€”in the Balkins, the Caucauses, in the Middle East, East Asia, and Africaâ€”still simmer. We have much to
demonstrate what we have learned from the last century. Without freedom, without the rule of law, without the
opportunity for people to support themselves and their families â€“ without basic human rights-- anger, aggression and
violence will prevail.

Today we are faced with difficult and often dangerous conflicts arising not from conflicts between nations but within
them, conflicts exploited by zealots who make the false claim that violence will purify the world and open the gates of
heaven. Once zealots tried to use this Gate to symbolize that message. But through the courage and determination of
the people of Berlin and their stalwart allies, this Gate now stands for a true revolution of the spirit. The long twilight
struggle to tear down this wall to make Europe whole and free inspires us, in this new century, to help other peoples
gain the same measure of security, respect and progress.
We need Berlin more than ever today. We need your courage, your fortitude, your commitment to the rights of menâ€”
and womenâ€”we need your example. We are hardly at the end of the history of the West. Standing here, where a wall
once stood but is no more, in the light from the Gate, we have learned from history's deepest lessons. Our alliance,
linked by shared struggle, dedicated to the ideals of freedom and democracy, strong from the world we have built, now
faces a new world of challenges. And we are ready to meet and conquer them. We know it has been done before. We
are free menâ€”and womenâ€”and proud to say, We are all Berliners.

The Berlin event is personally meaningful for me, not least because I was, in 1986, when I was a reporter for the
Washington Post, detained and held in a cell inside the Berlin Wall, after spending a night with dissidents in the east
(who wound up being the leaders of New Forum and overthrew the regime). Have fun at the AdIon (William Shirer's old

I have asked to take the lead in the H1N1 negotiations, and she has been participating in the meetings with
WH, HHS, DOD and others. At this time, she is leading the discussions with other donors â€” UK, Australia, Swiss and
others â€” so they can work in a coordinated fashion under our leadership. Her expertise and knowledge in this area has
really helped in interacting with HHS and addressing the technical issues. She has also participated in meetings with Jack
Lew. I expect that this effort will require a considerable amount of her time for the next few weeks.
With the departure of and because we are in the middle of addressing the H1N1 pandemic, I recommend B5

I would be happy to talk about this if useful.

Dear Hillary,
I very much hope we have a chance to spend some time with you next week for the ""Sanya Initiatove"" in DC with four
other American Four Stars and our Chinese counterparts. You will recall this is part of what I've been trying to do under
our ""complementary engagement"" program, which I briefly mentioned to you.
I understand our offices are working on the schedules, but nothing is firm yet.
Your personal involvement with this group - perhaps a small lunch - would be a very important message seen at the
highest levels of the Chinese government and the Central Military Commission.
I'd be personally grateful not only on behalf of our group, but also on behalf of a cause that I believe will be a part of
leading to a trusting relationship between our militaries so that we will have friends in China - not enemies.,
Warm, best regards,

I spoke to Ann and she sd that you always have the Trustee box to use in each House.
She cannot hold a box for The Secretary of State use only not - bt can further discussions with KC on this
She advises that we need to give advance notice -
There are 4 seat in the Eisenhower that are complimentary and then 4 that would need to be purchased for nominal fee
(seems like a really silly policy) The same for Opera and in the Symphony there are 12 all complimentary. I think if we
begin to use the box on a regular basis we can work with them on the cost issues.
This could be a lovely way to serve many special guests.
Let me know if you want to begin a process of reviewing the KC calendar and start a list of recommendations to invite.

Chairman of the Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific and the Global Environment, Congressman Eni F.H. Faleomavaega,
and Congresswoman Laura Richardson (D-CA), announced today that the U.S. Department of State called them this

morning to inform them that Secretary Clinton has authorized the use of funds from the Office of Foreign Disaster
Assistance (OFDA) to get emergency relief supplies airlifted from the greater Los Angeles area to Samoa in response to
the devastating tsunami that struck Apia on September 29.
In his capacity as Chairman of the Asia Pacific Subcommittee which has broad jurisdiction for U.S. foreign policy affecting
the region, including Samoa, Chairman Faleomavaega personally spoke to Secretary Clinton on Oct 1 and, in letters
dated Oct 4 and Oct 5, followed up with her regarding the specific need to airlift emergency supplies to Apia, which
were gathered by the Samoan communities and congregations in the greater Los Angeles area.
The Samoan communities in the greater Los Angeles directly contacted Faleomavaega for assistance because many of
their families and relatives live in his district of American Samoa or Samoa. Congresswoman Laura Richardson has
worked closely with Faleomavaega throughout this process given that she represents part of the greater Los Angeles
area, and the Samoan communities living in that area are her constituents.
""I want to personally thank Secretary Clinton for her untiring efforts in getting these relief supplies airlifted,"" Chairman
Faleomavaega said. ""Since the tsunami struck, Secretary Clinton has spared no effort in coming to our aid, and even
called upon the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) to quickly move these supplies from the West Coast to Samoa. Last
evening, Congresswoman Richardson and I learned that DOD had agreed to move the supplies but that due to legalities
of moving privately-donated goods, the process would take too long.""
""In a previous conference call yesterday, anticipating that DOD might be unable to quickly move these supplies, we
requested the State Department to fund a commercial flight through the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance should we
encounter any problems with DOD,"" Faleomavaega and Rep. Richardson said. ""Last night, upon learning that the DOD
process would take too long and in consideration of our request for a more immediate airlift, Secretary Clinton assessed
the options while en route to Europe, and this morning the State Department informed us that Secretary Clinton has
agreed to fund the flight with OFDA funds.""
""The agreement is that this will be a one-time airlift, and our Samoan communities should make future donations in
cash, rather than in commodities. We will not be able to airlift frozen goods, and our offices will work closely with the
communities to gather the supplies to a central location for the airlift. Also, the airlift provided by the U.S. Department
of State can only be authorized to land in Samoa. While we were also hopeful to get supplies in to American Samoa, all
matters relating to American Samoa are decided between the Governor and FEMA, according to federal law.""
""I know from my meeting earlier this week with Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi that he is thankful to the
Samoan congregations and communities in the greater Los Angeles area who responded from the heart by collecting
critical supplies that will now be airlifted to those in need,"" Faleomavaega said. ""For this reason, I want to thank the
Prime Minister for agreeing to accept this gift, and I also want to thank Reverend Liki Tiatia, Reverend John Mailo,
Reverend Misipauena Tagaloa, and High Chief Loa Pele Faletogo for all the good work they have done. Reverend Tiatia
and Reverend Mailo will be taking a flight to Samoa to make the presentation to the Government of Samoa on behalf of
our Samoan community on the West Coast and also on behalf of Congresswoman Richardson and myself.""
""I especially want to thank Congresswoman Richardson for working around the clock in support of our Samoan
communities living in her district, and in Samoa and American Samoa,"" Faleomavaega continued. ""Congresswoman
Richardson has stood by us every step of the way and has left no stone unturned in getting this done. She has been
staunch and solid in her dedication to us, and has earned her rightful place in our hearts. It is my honor to welcome
Congresswoman Richardson into our Pacific Island family.""
""With so many people in need of basic supplies in Samoa, it has been a privilege to work with Chairman Faleomavaega
to assist the people of my district in making sure the items they have collected will soon be in the hands of their families
and friends,"" Congresswoman Richardson said. ""This feat is only possible because of the dedication of Chairman
Faleomavaega and Secretary Clinton. Over 60 local organizations in the 37th district of California, including church

groups, non-profit organizations and caring others collected over 100,000 pounds of essential items to send to victims of
the tragedy that recently occurred. The lives of thousands of Samoans will be immediately and directly improved by the
actions taken by Secretary Clinton, Chairman Faleomavaega and all of us who answered the call to help. I am proud to
be a part of this exceptional team.""
""It is clear that change has come and that Secretary Clinton is restoring America's stature once again, especially in a part
of the world that the U.S. has too long neglected. We thank Secretary Clinton for her leadership and commitment, and
for standing with the people of Samoa when they need her most, and we continue to extend our deepest condolences
to the families and friends of those who are suffering so much,"" Faleomavaega and Rep. Richardson concluded.

July â€” August 2009

AFT Consultant
American Federation of Teachers
Education Support Team Mission
Kabul, Afghanistan
July-August 2009
Assignment
My plane departed New York Kennedy for Kabul on July 28th and the refrain replayed
and replayed in my head ""you are going where? Afghanistan. And why?"" I was recruited by the
AFT' s international department to support the Afghan Teacher Education Department's RPM
(Rapid Production of Materials) activity in which two dozen curriculum experts wrote teacher
training materials for classroom teachers. The other two members of the AFT team, Betty Harris
(ABC California) and Amber Prentice (St. Paul), arrived in late August
The RPM took place daily over a period of five weeks at the Sayyed Jumalladin Teacher
Training College in Kabul. Twenty Afghan educators were organized into three groups, each
responsible for completing the training manuals for one grade level (4-6, 7-9 and 10-12). For
each subject at each grade level, a module of five 90-minute training sessions was created. This
activity was part of the ongoing USAID program aimed at providing in-service training to all
Afghan teachers across eleven provinces of the country. My primary assignment was to review
an English translation of sessions as they were produced and to make technical edits which
facilitated the flow and focus without losing the voice and intent of the Afghan authors.
The site staff included three translators and three Provincial Monitoring Officers
(PMO's) who had been diverted from training in the field in order to work on the RPM. The
PMO's played an important role in facilitating the whole project and in helping the AFT team to
positively influence the process. They were knowledgeable about pedagogical theories, teacher
training, and the needs of teachers in the field. We had regular daily conversations about teacher
and trainer needs and how to meet them. The PMO's then shared these ideas with the RPM
groups. Before sessions were translated into English for my review, the PMO's also reviewed,
edited and discussed the material with the drafting groups. This nuanced intervention by the
PMO's substantially improved the quality of the initial drafts.
In addition to editing, I was encouraged to monitor the drafting work and interact with
RPM participants. It soon became clear that Afghan teachers in the field needed low-prep, low-
resource ideas for encouraging active student learning. I made several short presentations to the
whole group on low resource teaching tools, such as two sheets of paper folded over into a four-
section flipbook. This becomes a handy organizer of information for students and teachers alike.
The PMO's helped to connect the ideas in my presentations to the specific interests of the
audience.
The AFT team's experience as working teachers and professional developers was
valuable in facilitating the RPM at several key points. For example, we were able to apply our
experience in coordinating the activities and output of large groups of teachers. We created
graphic organizers which listed all the modules/sessions to be produced so that each stage of
production could be monitored easily. This helped the groups to establish and maintain a pace of

work which led to the completion of all of their training materials on schedule. We were also
able to suggest practices, such as deliberate labeling of the teaching strategy and grouping for
each activity, which helped to produce higher quality drafts.
A great challenge to the production of effective training manuals was that they would
have to survive a ""cascade"" of at least three levels of turnkey training while retaining clarity and
effectiveness for final delivery to the often under-prepared, under-resourced, teachers in the
field. The training process had to build the skills of teachers, deepen their content knowledge,
and establish a foundation for ongoing professional collaboration at the school level. Moreover,
the teachers in the field, at least, would not be paid for attending the trainings, so the training
materials had to be coherent and speak to their immediate needs. One of the most important
AFT team contributions was to address these challenges by refining the five training sessions for
each subject into templates with standardized formats and language. The templates respected the
language and content choices of the Afghan drafters, but also helped to ensure that the training
could be executed effectively by moderately skilled trainers.
When my colleagues Betty Harris (ABC California) and Amber Prentice (St. Paul)
arrived in late August, the ground had been prepared for our team to complete the technical
editing of the Grades 4-6 RPM materials on schedule, to present appropriate teacher training
ideas to an audience of RPM participants and other Teacher Education Department officials, and
to consult constructively with the PMO's and NGO partners of Creative regarding the plans for
the implementation of the training materials.
Comments
o An earlier arrival would have helped the AFT team to make more strategic contributions
to the process, such as deepening participants' understanding of group learning activities
before they started drafting them.
o It was an advantage to send one member of the AFT team ahead in order to get a feel for
the project and prepare the ground for the rest of the team.
o Close interaction with Afghan educators helped us to discern some important issues.
These included the importance of recruiting and supporting first grade teachers, who are
often the first contact with formal education for children and their families, especially in
towns and villages. We also learned that there is a high dropout rate during Grades 4 to
6. It emerged that there is substantial variation in attitudes toward education in different
regions of the country, where local experience and tradition exert such powerful
influences.
â€¢ Language barriers, despite the help of translators, inhibited the kind of nuanced group
facilitation in which AFT/Teacher Center trainers are skilled.
o Helping to refine the flow of the twelve-day trainings is where our AFT experience and
skills would be especially valuable. We expected that Amber would be involved in this
for much of September, but there were apparently some delays.
o Some delays were undoubtedly due to the difficulties of retranslation of our edited
sessions back into Dani and Pashtu. The similar format and language of the edited
sessions was expected to save time in translation after the first example was complete,
but apparently this did not flow as smoothly as we had hoped.

Collaboration with Creative Associates
I was profoundly impressed by the qualities of the local Afghan staff who work with the
U.S. contractor Creative Associates. They are serious people. In particular, the three Provincial
Monitoring Officers who worked on the RPM project demonstrated real depth of knowledge
about pedagogy, understanding of effective practices of professional development, and
familiarity with conditions in the field which are likely to influence the effectiveness of the RPM
training materials. The ancillary staff (translators and typists) were sometimes inconsistent in
their attendance and in the volume of their work. However, they always cheerfully helped with
presentations and facilitated interactions with non-English speakers.
Comments
o Better communication before our arrival would have facilitated better decisions about
what materials to bring and helped us to plan ahead in order to utilize most fully the skills
and experience of the AFT team.
O The practice of regular reporting to the COP and at staff meetings helped us to ensure that
the priorities, pace and quality of work were consistent with expectations.
o There was some confusion in working with the Afghan translators. They were cheerful
and professional, but it was difficult accurately to assess the efficiency of their work as
they translated the RPM materials back into Dan and Pashtu.
Living and Working Conditions
Accomodation at Creative's ""Green House"" residence in Kabul was comfortable but not
lavish. The rooms were air-conditioned (a necessity) and mine had its own bath. Local staff
cooked excellent meals took care of the rooms and our laundry. On a couple of occasions, we
were able to entertain people to meals. It certainly felt safe, since the gates were secured by
guards around the clock and the deputy security manager lived in.
For most of August, there were strict restrictions on movement. Even a short walk down
the street to the Creative main office involved half a dozen of the security staff. It was easy to
arrange with the security manager for outings in the evening to guarded restaurants which
catered to foreigners and for visits to the grocery store and certain secure shops. Tourist
activities such as strolling through the bazaar or along the main streets were not possible. After
Betty and Amber arrived, we were able to visit the National Museum (with evidence of multiple
lootings still visible) and the palace of the former Kings. The latter was an engrossing though
eerie experience â€” in many ways a symbol of all the havoc wrought upon Afghanistan by a
generation of war.
Conditions out at the teacher training site were rather more challenging. Although
traveling in an armored vehicle, we were often stuck in traffic jams and the trip sometimes took
upwards of forty-five minutes. The site was a spacious classroom in the middle of the Kabul
Teachers' College campus. There were crowds of students everywhere, but one of the Creative
security staff was always on duty at the door, while the car remained just outside throughout the
day. Until the election lockdown began in mid-August, we were out at the RPM site five and a
half days a week. The workday generally ran from 8:30 to about 3:30. We seldom moved from

the room until leaving at the end of the day. During one week the heat regularly reached 110
degrees. There were electric fans and water coolers, but the flies and dust steadily swirling
through the open windows were hard on the people and computer equipment alike. When
working at the Creative main office, we were given our own desk space.
Comments
â€¢ Living conditions might seem a bit spartan to person attached to the comforts of home or
a hotel.
â€¢ Working conditions out at the Sayyed Jumalladin Teacher College site would be difficult
for a person unaccustomed to heat, dust, flies and minimal amenities.
â€¢ All movement outside of the residences is tightly controlled. One cannot stroll around
the neighborhood.
â€¢ On several occasions, we were conscious of gunfire and explosions in the general
vicinity. A person who felt especially nervous about random rockets at night or
explosions on the streets during the day would have found this mission difficult.
â€¢ Social life in Kabul exists, but is restricted by security considerations.
Assessment
This summer's collaboration in Afghanistan between the AFT and Ministry of Education
was a remarkable success. The skills and experience of the AFT team were well matched to the
needs of the BESST project. We shared in common with the Afghan educators so many similar
concerns about the training and support of teachers that it was it was easy to step in and support
the production of training manuals. The Provincial Monitoring Officers were remarkably
effective in helping us to understand and respond to the needs of Afghan teachers. The Creative
team in Kabul were practical, open-minded, and welcomed our participation in the project. Our
full AFT team of three persons, although only together for a week, was able to collaborate
frankly and efficiently from the start. Our primary tasks â€” supporting the rapid production by
Afghan educators of teacher training materials and preparing the Grades 4-6 manual for
publication â€” were completed on time and to a high standard of quality. The project could not
have been more serious. Our AFT Team, in my opinion, made a substantive contribution to the
idea that Afghan teachers can be a community of educators.
This was a marvellous professional experience. It has convinced me that if Americans
listen carefully and lead pragmatically, we can help Afghans to build a professional community
of educators which could be a sturdy foundation for civil society. The AFT, with our tradition of
practical support in response to the needs of teachers in the classroom, can fill an essential role in
the process.
Recommendations for the AFT in responding to the needs of educators in Afganistan
â€¢ Train Afghan educators in the use of low-prep, low-resource dependent strategies for
supporting active student learning, including graphic organizers and paper manipulatives;
â€¢ Share and support practices for developing reading materials which are both
developmentally and culturally appropriate, such as collections of stories about local
families, occupations, traditions, and history;

â€¢ Share experience and help develop techniques for handling large classes (sometimes of
100 students or more), especially in the early grades;
â€¢ Share experience in effective instructional planning and execution under circumstances
where the school day, school year, and student attendance are not consistent;
â€¢ Help Afghan Teacher Education Department officials and the teachers whom they train
and monitor to understand the value of formative assessments in monitoring student
learning, especially with regard to proficiency in reading and writing;
â€¢ Provide training in Curriculum Mapping and strategies for sustaining the practice so that
Afghan educators are enabled to coordinate their efforts among subjects, grade levels and
schools;
â€¢ Disseminate aspects of brain research with immediate, obvious application to instruction,
such as how the link between age and the length of attention span can inform lesson
planning;
â€¢ Support more efficient planning and instruction by teachers in the field by providing
templates, strategies for setting priorities, and techniques for self-evaluation;
â€¢ At the policy level, in training for school leaders, and in training for teachers, present a
paradigm of differentiated instruction which synthesizes common sense experience with
theories of learning into an agenda for sustained improvement of teaching and learning.
In support of this objective, I would recommend translating and adapting Judy Dodge's
Differentiation in Action and 25 Short Formative Assessments. These ideas are
digestible in small bites by teachers with limited resources;
â€¢ Support the expansion and refinement of Teacher Learning Circles (school-based
professional groups);
â€¢ Introduce and support effective practices for organizing, mobilizing, and sustaining
structures for local collaboration, such as Teacher Learning Circles, Lead Teachers,
community sponsorship of school activities, and provincial/district resource centers;
â€¢ Share experience in techniques for building connects between schools and parents;
â€¢ Help to develop a plan for teacher induction, development and retention;
â€¢ Share experience in developing supports for 1st Grade teachers, who play a critical role in
Afghanistan as the first point of contact with formal education for many children and
their parents;
â€¢ Help Afghan educators to widen the area of common language, experience and
benchmarks for proficiency in the teaching profession;
â€¢ Through training of administrators, lead teachers, and instructional specialists, facilitate
supportive school supervision and provincial leadership;
â€¢ Support analysis of the high drop-out rate in Grades 4-6 and help to develop strategic
responses so that more children move on to middle and high school;
â€¢ Share low-cost but effective practices for acknowledging and encouraging professional
accomplishment by teachers;
â€¢ Share techniques for building professional connections among teachers across provincial
boundaries. (The current set-up seems to be of the hub and spokes variety, with national
TED in Kabul at the hub, provincial TED's at the end of the spokes, and very little
reciprocal communication even between the national and provincial administrative
centers);
